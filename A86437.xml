            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>PArt of theſe things now publiſhed were intended to have been Printed and Publiſhed in the former Volume; but not being ſo well Tranſcribed as I thought was neceſſary for the Preſs, being not in place to ſee it corrected my ſelf, and the Term being ſo near that they could not be made ready and Printed before that time, at the requeſt of the Book-ſellers, who were loth to loſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of that Term for the publication of that Volume, I was content to let them publiſh that alone as it is without any more: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding afterward intended this other Volume, adding thereunto ſome other ſmall things, more than at first were intended, to make it a juſt Volume near the proportion of the former, provided it could be ſo timely finiſhed, as that it might appear to be but a part of the former Treſpaſs, though with a <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ando,</hi> and not a new preſumption againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:152948:3"/>worthy Authour: But when part of it had been ſo long detained in the hands of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencers, that by reaſon thereof, and of ſome other interventions, that could not be, I was unwilling to appear to the World to be guilty of a ſecond Treſpaſs againſt ſo excellent a perſon, eſpecially, having both craved and obtained his pardon for the former, and therefore wrote to the Book-ſellers to deſiſt from proceeding any farther therein, till ſome fair occaſion might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ſelf to do it either with the Authours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs conſent, or at least without offence to him.</p>
                  <p>But it was not long before I was much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by ſome ſpecial friends of the Authors to let them proceed, and among the rest by a Perſon of Quality, who hath a very high reſpect and eſteem both for Him and his Writings, and to whom I am very much obliged; and beſides, I perceived that the Authour himſelf was very much importuned by ſome friends and perſons of Quality for more of his Writings of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that which I did before foreſee would be one conſequence of the publication of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Volume; for although he hath written much of this nature, it having been long the imployment of his <hi>Horae Sacrae,</hi> yet hath ſcarce any, even of his moſt intimate friends or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, except my ſelf, and ſome of his own Family, known ſo much. But by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb facs="tcp:152948:3"/>of theſe importunities of other friends, I did the more eaſily prevail with him to give leave that the Book-ſellers might go on with what they were about. And thus the Reader comes to enjoy the benefit of this ſecond Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>the Treatiſes</hi> contained in it, there is one upon the ſame Subject with one of thoſe in the former Volume, that is, <hi>Of Afflictions,</hi> but ſuch (to ſay no more) as doubtleſs will not ſeem tedious to any Pious perſon, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready read the former. For his <hi>Meditations upon the Lords Prayer,</hi> they are ſo excellent, and ſo far beyond what I am able to ſay in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of them, that I ſhall leave it to the ſenſe of the Reader, who if he have any reliſh of ſincere Religion, Piety, and Devotion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be highly affected with them. <hi>For thoſe ſhorter Meditations</hi> I muſt acquaint the Reader that they were written when the Author was not only in his Journeyes, but in ſuch Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, wherein he had leſs freedom by reaſon of the Company, which was then with him, than he did ordinarily take, when he had none but his own Attendants about him; for I find in divers of them noted when and where they were written. And theſe I was the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhould be publiſhed in this Volume with the others, becauſe if the Importunities of friends,
<pb facs="tcp:152948:4"/>which have not, nor will be wanting, can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly prevail with the Author to publiſh any more of this kind himſelf, I ſuppoſed he would rather make choice of ſome of his larger and more compleat writings, than of theſe (whereof ſome were never finiſhed) which yet I doubt not but will be very acceptable and profitable to the Pious Reader, but poſſibly otherwiſe might not have been publiſhed at all. And even from theſe ſhorter Meditations the Reader may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a double benefit: The matter of them may be ſuch to him of it ſelf; but beſides they exhibit an excellent <hi>Example</hi> in their Author, as of the conſtant Pious and virtuous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his mind in general ſo in particular of his conſtant care to imploy thoſe pretious por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time, as he calls them, his <hi>Horae Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crae,</hi> in ſuitable and profitable Meditations, from which he would not ſuffer himſelf to be wholly diverted, either by his Company, or any other of thoſe occurrences, by which we are often too apt to excuſe our ſelves from the Duties and Exerciſes of Religion and Piety.</p>
                  <p>Let the pious Reader pray for the Prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Life, and the Reſtitution of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent meaſure of Health and Strength unto him; which if it pleaſe God to grant, doubtleſs his Studies in Private will be no leſs beneficial to Poſterity, than his Actions in Publick have been
<pb facs="tcp:152948:4"/>to the preſent age, though the Conſequence of theſe will reach to Poſterity alſo.</p>
                  <p>Being far diſtant from the Preſs, I muſt again crave the Readers favour to pardon and correct the miſtakes of the Printer.</p>

                  <head>AN INQUIRY TOUCHING HAPPINESS.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ANy man that compares the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> with that of the <hi>Animal Nature,</hi> will eaſily find a far <hi>greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence</hi> in the former than in the latter: For 1. The Faculties of the former are more Sublime and Noble: 2. The very External Fabrick of the former much more Beautiful and fuller of Majeſty than the latter: 3. The latter ſeems to be in a very great meaſure ordained in a Subſerviency to the former: Some for his Food, ſome for Cloathing, ſome for Uſe and Service, ſome for Delight: 4. All the inferiour Animals ſeem to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under the Diſcipline, Regiment, and Order of Mankind; ſo that he brings them all, or the moſt of them, under his Order and Subjection:</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:152948:7"/>
                  <p n="2">2. It is therefore Juſt and Reaſonable for us to think, that if the Inferiour Animals have a kind of <hi>Felicity or Happineſs</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their being, and ſuitable to it, that much more Man, the nobler being, ſhould not be deſtitute of any Happineſs attending his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuitable to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But rather conſequently, that Man, being the nobler Creature, ſhould not only have an Happineſs as well as Inferiour Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, but he ſhould have it placed in ſome more Noble and Excellent rank and kind than that wherein the Brutes have their Happineſs placed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is plain that <hi>the Inferiour Animals have a Happineſs or Felicity proportionate to their Nature</hi> and Fabrick; which as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly deſire, ſo they do in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Enjoy: namely, a ſenſible Good, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering their ſenſible Appetite. Every thing hath <hi>Organs</hi> and Inſtruments anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Uſe and Convenience of their Faculties; <hi>Organs</hi> for their Senſe and Local motion, and for their Feeding, for their Generation of their kind: Every thing hath its peculiar <hi>Inſtincts</hi> and Connatural Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Energies for the Exerciſes of their <hi>Organs</hi> and Faculties for their Preſervation and Nouriſhment: Every thing hath a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>of External Objects</hi> anſwering thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152948:7"/>Deſires and Inſtincts; Meats proper for their Nouriſhment; Places proper for their Repoſe; difference of Sexes in their ſeveral kinds anſwering their Procreative Appetite: And moſt commonly ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Health and Integrity of Nature, as goes a long to that period of time allotted for their duration; and in default thereof they are for the moſt part furniſhed with Medicines naturally provided for them, which they naturally know and uſe, ſo that they ſeem to want nothing that is neceſſary to the complement of a Senſible Felicity.</p>
                  <p>It is true, they are in a great meaſure <hi>Subjected to the Dominion of Mankind,</hi> which is ſometimes over ſeverely exerciſed, but then they have the Benefit of Supplies from them, Protection under them, and, if they meet not with Maſters more unreaſonable than themſelves, they find Moderation from them. They are alſo <hi>expoſed to the Rapine one of another,</hi> the weaker Beaſts, Birds and Fiſhes, being commonly the prey of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but yet they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly endued with Nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

But be theſe what Abatements of their Senſible Happineſs may be, yet they have certain <hi>Negative Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> that conduce very much to their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152948:8"/>or at leaſt remove very much of what might abate it, and thereby render their fruition more free and perfect and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, for inſtance, they ſeem to have no Anticipations or Fear of Death as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Evil incident to their nature: They have no Anticipations of Dangers till they immediately preſent themſelves unto them: They have no great ſenſe or apprehenſions of any thing better than what at preſent they enjoy: They are not under the Obligation of any Law, or under the Senſe of any ſuch thing, and conſequently the Sincereneſs of what they enjoy, not interrupted by the ſtrokes of Conſcience under a ſenſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from Duty, or Guilt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is therefore plain, that if the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> have no greater or better Happineſs than what is accommodate only to a Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nature, they have no greater Happineſs than the Beaſts have, which is not reaſonable to be ſuppoſed for a Nature ſo far exceeding them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Farther yet, if the Humane Nature were not under a capacity of a greater Happineſs than what is terminated in Senſe, mankind were much more <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy</hi> than the baſeſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal; and the more Excellent the Humane Nature is above the Beaſts, nay, the more excellent any one individual of the Humane
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152948:8"/>kind were above another, the more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he were, and the more uncapable of being in any meaſure happy: for the more Wiſe and Sagacious any man were, the more he muſt needs be <hi>ſenſible of Death,</hi> which ſenſe would ſower all the Happineſs of a ſenſible Good: the more ſenſible he muſt needs be, not only of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of ſenſible Enjoyments, but alſo of their Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Emptineſs, Inſufficiency, Diſſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs. It is evident, that a Fool ſets a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rate upon a Senſible Good than a Man truly Wiſe, and conſequently the Fool could be the only man capable of Happineſs: for it is moſt certain, that according to the meaſure of the Eſteem that any man hath of any good he enjoys, ſuch is the meaſure of his Happineſs in that Enjoyment, Since the Happineſs is ſomewhat that is intrinſecal to the Senſe or Mind that enjoys it. A thing really Good can never make that man Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who is under a Senſe of Evil or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience by that enjoyment, ſo long as he is under that ſenſe. Since therefore it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that Man, the beſt of terreſtrial Creatures, and Wiſe men, the beſt of men, ſhould be Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from at leaſt an equal degree of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with the Beaſts that periſh; and ſince it muſt needs be that a bare Senſible Good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152948:9"/>can never communicate to a man an Equal degree of Happineſs with a Beaſt, nor to a Wiſe man an Equal degree of Happines with a Fool, it remains, there muſt needs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon be ſome other ſubject wherein the Happineſs of a Man, of a Wiſe Man, muſt conſiſt, that is not barely Senſible Good.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All <hi>the good things of this Life</hi> they are but Senſible Goods, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the true matter of that Happineſs, which we may reaſonably think belongs to the reaſonable Nature as ſuch, the former will appear by an induction of particulars, which I ſhall purſue in order, with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances of their Inſufficiencies to make up a true Happineſs to the Reaſonable Nature, as well as that general that they are but Senſible Goods, and meerly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to a Senſible Life and Nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Life it ſelf</hi> is not as ſuch a ſufficient conſtituent of Happineſs: and the Inſtance is Evident, becauſe it is poſſible that Life it ſelf may be Miſerable: there may be Life where there is Sickneſs, Pain, Diſgrace, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and all thoſe External Occurrences that may render life Grievous and Burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Life may indeed be the Subject of Happineſs, when it hath all thoſe contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that concur to make it ſuch; but Life alone, and as ſuch, cannot be Happineſs,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152948:9"/>becauſe there may be a Miſerable Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe <hi>Bona Corporis</hi> or <hi>Compoſiti,</hi> the Goods of the Body, are not ſufficient to make up a ſuitable Happineſs to the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Nature; as <hi>Health, Strength;</hi> for the Beaſts themſelves enjoy this, and for the moſt part, the Brutes enjoy a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of theſe than Mankind: and beſides ſtill, there is that which is like the Worm at the root of the Gourd, that ſpoils the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that muſt ariſe from it; <hi>viz.</hi> Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Death, which will certainly pull down this Tabernacle, and Man hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intermitted Pre-apprehenſion of it, which ſowers the very enjoyment it ſelf. And in this as hath been ſaid, the Beaſts that periſh have a pre-eminence over Mankind; for though both are Mortal, yet the Beaſt is not under that Pre-apprehenſion of it that Man inceſſantly hath, whereby his Fruition of that Happineſs of Health is the more Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and this conſideration muſt run through all thoſe other contributions of Senſible Goods, that hereafter follow. And as for <hi>Beauty,</hi> the Happineſs thereof as it is but fading and empty, ſo the Felicity that it gives, is not to the party that hath it, but to others, unto whom perchance it may be a delightful and amiable ſpectacle, but not to him that hath it.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:152948:10"/>
                  <p n="3">3. There are a ſecondary ſort of Bodily Goods, namely, <hi>Pleaſures of the Senſes,</hi> as delightful Meats, Drinks, Sights, Muſick, pleaſant Odors, and other Gratifications of the Senſitive Appetite; or Luſt, as the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of Revenge, the Luſt of Deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe cannot make up a competent Happineſs to the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 1. They are but Senſible Goods, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Beaſts as well as Men. 2. Though they may be competent to make up the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Senſible Nature, yet they are not ſuch to the Reaſonable Nature; becauſe they are ſtill accompanied with a preſent concurring Senſe of Mortality, which Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters their very Enjoyment, and renders them inſipid, if not bitter. 3. The wiſer the Man is, the leſs he values them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are at beſt a Happineſs to Fools, and ſuch as degenerate from the Nobleneſs of the Humane Nature into the degree of Beaſts by ſetting an Over-value upon them. Again. 4. They are tranſient, and the Happineſs of them is only before their Enjoyment; when they are Enjoyed to Satiety, they loſe their Uſe and Value. 5. Theſe <hi>placenta ſenſus,</hi> eſpecially of the Senſual Appetite, are not for their own ſakes, but in order to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> To invite and excite the Appetite in order to the Preſervation of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152948:10"/>individual, or the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and therefore cannot be in themſelves in relation to a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Nature any Happineſs, ſince they terminate in ſomething elſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe <hi>Bona Fortunae,</hi> as Wealth, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Power, cannot at all pretend to make up a Happineſs for the Reaſonable Nature; for though in truth we do not find ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, in the animal Nature, any ſuch thing as Wealth or Honour, but only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what analogal to it, as in Ants and Bees; yet theſe are of a far inferiour nature to the <hi>Bona Corporis,</hi> whether Health or Pleaſure; for they are in their true Uſe only in order to them. The primary Corporeal Good is Health, and Conſervation of the individual in his being: next to that, and indeed in order to it, are the Refreſhments and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports by Eating and Drinking. <hi>Wealth</hi> again is Subſervient and in order to that, <hi>viz.</hi> To have a convenient Store and Proviſion for the ſupply of the exigencies of Nature and preſerving the individual: what is more then Neceſſary for that, is Superfluous, Vain, and Unneceſſary. <hi>Power</hi> again is only deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſecure thoſe Proviſions from Rapine and Invaſion: ſo that in truth theſe are ſo far from making up a Happineſs, that they are only Proviſional and in Order to thoſe Goods of the Body, which are before
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152948:11"/>ſhewn incompetent to that End; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that reſpect they are vain and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things. But beſides this, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Specifical Defects that accompany theſe Goods, that render them utterly uncapable of making up a Happineſs to Mankind: 1 It is impoſſible they can be as large as the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; becauſe unleſs there were ſome Poor, none could be Rich; unleſs ſome were Under, there could be none in Power; if all were equal in Wealth and Power, there could be no ſuch thing as Wealth or Power: and conſequently the ſuppoſition of Happineſs in thoſe who are Rich or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, would exclude the greateſt part of Mankind from any ſhare in that which muſt make up their common Happineſs. 2. In the fruition of all Wealth, Honour and Power, beſides the common fate of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which imbitters their very Enjoyment, there is annexed a certain peculiar Infelicity that renders them uncapable of making up a Happineſs: For, 1. They are the common mark of Covetouſneſs, Envy, Ambition, and Neceſſity, which moſt ordinarily render Rich and Powerful, and Great Men leſs ſafe than others, and ordinarily they ſtand tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering dangerouſly, and ſubject to fall. 2. There is always Care and Anxiety at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the poſſeſſors of Great Honour,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152948:11"/>Wealth, or Power, which imbitters the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry injoyment, and puts it out of the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being a Happineſs; for it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that great Cares and great Fears can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with true Happineſs. And thus far of Senſible Goods.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Beſides theſe Senſible Goods there ſeem to be two ſorts of <hi>Goods that Mankind is peculiarly capable of,</hi> which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Beaſts; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, The Good of <hi>Eſteem, Glory and Reputation,</hi> wherewith perchance the Beaſts are not affected, though ſome ſeem to have ſomewhat analogal to it, but this cannot at all make up a Happineſs to the Humane Nature: 1. Becauſe it is not accommodate to all Uſes and Exigents: <hi>Laudatur &amp; alget.</hi> 2. Becauſe it reſides not in the party, but in thoſe who give it; a man may have a great eſteem with others and a low eſteem of himſelf. 3. It is of all others the moſt brittle and unſtable poſſeſſion: thoſe that perchance deſervedly give it, may undeſervedly reſume it: a Word or Action miſtaken by others, a falſe Report, Envy, Emulation, want of ſucceſs in any one Action: the miſ-interpretation of the Superior or the Vulgar, may quite overturn the greateſt, and perchance moſt deſerved Reputation, and render a man more deſpiſed and contemptible than he was before emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152948:12"/>or eſteemed: he that bottoms his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs upon ſuch an unſtable blaſt, inherits the wind.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But yet there (are) certain <hi>Bona A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae</hi> which are competible to Man, but not to Beaſts, which are of two kinds, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the two great Faculties in Man, his Underſtanding and Will: <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledg, and Moral Virtues, and although theſe are excellent Goods, yet (excluſively of true and ſound Religion) they cannot make up that Happineſs which we may reaſonably Judg to be proper and ſpecifical to the Humane Nature: Firſt, Therefore for <hi>Knowledg</hi> there are theſe Incompetences in it, in reference to our Happineſs: 1. Our Knowledg is very little and narrow in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Object of it: What we know is the leaſt part of what we know not: Though we daily converſe with things natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, even with the frame of our own bodies, we ſcarce know the nature or cauſe or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any one Nerve or Muſcle. 2. Even in thoſe things we think we know, our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is very Dark and Uncertain; and from theſe ariſeth: 3. That our increaſe in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is our increaſe of Sorrow and Trouble: Trouble to attain that little Knowledg we have, and Sorrow in that we can acquire no more: 4. The whole Scheme of Knowledg
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152948:12"/>we attain, for the moſt part ſerves only the meridian of our ſhort, unſtable, uncertain life: And what kind of Happineſs can that be, which while we are attaining, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſecure to be of any long or certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and vaniſheth, or proves utterly unuſeful when we die? Of what uſe will then the knowledg of Municipal Laws, of Hiſtory, of Natural Philoſophy, of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, of Mathematicks, be in the next World, although our Souls Survive us?</p>
                  <p>As to the 2. Namely, <hi>Moral Virtues:</hi> It is true, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 1. <hi>Ethicor. Cap.</hi> 7. Tells us that Happineſs or Bleſſedneſs is the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or Operation of the Reaſonable Soul, according to the beſt and moſt perfect Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>in vita perfecta,</hi> in a perfect Life: But he tells us not what that <hi>vita perfecta</hi> is, nor where to be found, and yet without it there is no Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>But even this exerciſe of Virtue (though much more noble than the bare habit of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is but in order to Action or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe) if conſidered ſingly and apart, and abſtractively from the reward of it, is not enough to conſtitute a Happineſs ſuitable to the Humane Nature: 1. The Actions of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for the moſt part reſpect the good and benefit of others more than of the party that exerciſeth them, as Juſtice, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152948:13"/>Charity, Liberality, Fortitude; and principally (if not only) Religion, Temperance, Patience, and Contentation, are thoſe Virtues that advantage the party himſelf; the reſt moſt reſpect the good of others. 2. We find it too often true, that moſt good men have the leaſt ſhare of the comforts and conveniencies of this Life, but are expoſed (many times even upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their very Virtues) to Poverty, Want, Reproach, Neglect, ſo that their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Virtues are occaſions oftentimes of ſuch Calamities, which muſt needs abate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Life, which is a neceſſary ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient into Happineſs. 3. But if their life be not rendred grievous upon the account of their Virtues, yet they are not thereby priviledged from many Calamities, which render their lives unhappy, and oftentimes renders them uncapable of the exerciſe of thoſe Virtues, which muſt make up their Happineſs: Poverty diſables them from acts of Liberality; Neglect and Scorn by great Men and Governors renders them uncapable of acts of diſtributive Juſtice; Sickneſs and tormenting bodily Diſeaſes many times attack them, and render their lives miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and many times diſables even their very intellectuals; and to theſe diſaſters they are at leaſt equally lyable with others; and if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152948:13"/>all theſe Calamities were abſent, yet there are two ſtates of life, which they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily go through if they live, that in a great meaſure renders them neceſſarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of theſe actions of Virtue, namely, the Paſſions and Perturbations of Youth, and the decays and infirmities of Old Age. 4. The higheſt Good attainable by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Virtue in the party himſelf is Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Mind; and indeed it is a noble and excellent portion; but as the caſe ſtands with us in this life, (without a farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a life to come,) even ſuch a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind is not perfectly attainable by us, and hath certain appendances to it, that abate that ſincereneſs of Happineſs, that is requirable in it, to compleat the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Humane Nature: and theſe are principally theſe two: 1. The neceſſity that we are under (conſidering the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our nature) by our daily failings, Errors, and Sins, to turn aſide from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule of Virtue; whereby we are under a kind of moral neceſſity of violating or abating that Tranquillity of mind; ſo that it ſeems in it ſelf morally impoſſible either fully to attain, or conſtantly and uniformly to hold that Tranquillity of mind: 2. Still Mortality, Mortality, Death, and the Grave terminates this Felicity, if it only reſpect
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152948:14"/>this life; and the fear and pre-apprehenſion of ſuch a termination ſowers and allays even that Felicity, which Tranquillity of mind otherwiſe offers: This fear and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of death (as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.) detains men Captive all the days of their life, and in a great meaſure breaks that Tranquillity of mind, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent of this Happineſs. Again, though Virtue, and Virtuous actions have had their <hi>Elogia</hi> by excellent Philoſophers, Orators, Poets, and we are told by them, that <hi>Si Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus oculis cerneretur,</hi> it would appear the moſt beautiful thing in the World; yet it hath had but few followers in reſpect of the reſt of the World; and poſſibly would find a much colder entertainment, if the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward were not alſo propounded with it and believed: Therefore there is and muſt be ſomewhat elſe beſides bare Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Notions of Virtue and naked propoſals of it, that muſt give it a conqueſt over the ſatisfaction of our Luſts and Pleaſures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the time of our Youth and Strength, and before old age overtake us.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, that in all ages wiſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Governors have annexed ſenſible Rewards and Honours, and ſuch things as have a lively and quick reliſh with them unto the exerciſe of Virtue.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:152948:14"/>
                  <p>And hence it is that the moſt wiſe God himſelf hath not propounded Virtue and Goodneſs to the children of men ſingly as its own and only Reward, but hath alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and really and effectually provided a Recompence of Reward for it, that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which I have been all this while in queſt after, and hath made Virtue and Goodneſs the way, the method to attain that happineſs, which is in truth the end of it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole matter I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Happineſs of Mankind is not to be found in this life, but it is a flower that grows in the Garden of Eternity, and to be expected only in its full complement and fruition in that life which is to ſucceed after our bodily diſſolution: that although Peace of Conſcience, Tranquillity of mind, and the ſenſe of the favour of God, that we enjoy in this Life, like the bunches of Grapes brought by the Spies from <hi>Canaan,</hi> are the prelibations and anticipations of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, yet the complement of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts in the Beatifical Viſion of the ever bleſſed God to all Eternity; where there is a <hi>vita perfecta,</hi> a perfect life free from Pain, from Sorrow, from Cares, from Fears, <hi>vita perfecta,</hi> a perfect life of Glory and Immortality, out of the reach or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152948:15"/>of Death, or the loſs of that Happineſs, which we ſhall then enjoy in the preſence of the ever Glorious God, in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe right hand are Pleaſures for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>The End which moſt concerns us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152948:16"/>after, is the end of our Being, why or for what end we were made: for as that is the thing of the greateſt moment to us, ſo the ignorance or miſtake therein is of the greateſt danger.</p>
                     <p>Now touching <hi>this End of Man,</hi> we muſt know,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That in all wiſe workers that act by deliberation and choice, the appointment of the end of any work belongs to him that makes it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In as much therefore as Mankind is in its Original the workmanſhip of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it belongs to him to appoint the end of his own workmanſhip; and of him it muſt be inquired.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That in as much as God is the wiſeſt worker, and in as much as Mankind is a piece of excellent workmanſhip, it becomes the Wiſdom of God, as to appoint man to an end of his own deſigning, ſo to appoint him to an end anſwerable to the excellency of the work, an end as much above other creatures, as man exceeds them in worth and excellency.</p>
                     <p>So that certainly Man is ordained by God to an End, and to an excellent End, beyond the condition of other inferior Creatures; for we ſee them all appointed for the uſe and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152948:16"/>ſervice of Man, to feed and cloath and heal and delight him.</p>
                     <p>What therefore is common to the Beaſts as well as Man, cannot be the End of Man. The Beaſts Eat, and Drink, and Live, and Propagate their kind with as much delight, and much more contentment than Man; they are free from Cares and from Fears, which Man is not, and though they die, ſo doth Man alſo; therefore to live, and eat, and drink, and perpetuate their kind is too low an End for Man. And if ſo, then much more is it below him to make Wealth, and Honor, and Power his End: For they are but in order to his temporal life here, either to provide for it, or to ſecure it: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, they cannot anſwer the deſires and continuance of an Immortal Soul, which Man bears with him: And hence grows the Wearineſs, and Vexation, and Unquietneſs, and Reſtleſneſs of Man, in the midſt of all Wealth, and Honors, and Pleaſures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is ſome other End, to which Man was appointed. Which is, 1. In reference to God, <hi>to glorifie him.</hi> 2. In reference to Man; an everlaſting injoyment of God.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. In his Will; whereby he ſubmits to him, Worſhips, Fears him, and in the courſe of his life Obeys him; whereby he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his Soveraignty, and ſubmits to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. <hi>He that offereth Praiſe, glorifieth him, and to him that orders his converſation aright, will I ſhew the Salvation of God.</hi> Both theſe are imperfectly done here, but ſhall be perfectly done in the life to come.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Why</hi> the Glorifying of God is made the Chief End of Man.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the Chief End that God propoſed in all his Works of Creation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>He made all things for himſelf;</hi> that is, his own Glory: In his Works of Preſervation and Providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> In his Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152948:17"/>
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his Grace, whereby he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> In his Work of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>That Men ſeeing your good Works, may glorifie your Father who is in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is but juſt it ſhould be the Chief End of Man to glorifie God; becauſe it is a moſt Reaſonable Tribute to pay to him, for all his Mercies and Goodneſs: From him we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Being, and all the Bleſſings of it, and it is but juſt for God to require, and for Man to perform, the due acknowledgment of the Goodneſs of that God, from whom he receives them, which is his Glorifying of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To injoy God for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Two things are to be explained. 1. <hi>What</hi> it is to injoy God. 2. <hi>Why</hi> this is part of the Chief End of Man?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To injoy God, is either, 1. In <hi>this Life,</hi> which is to have Peace with God, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Reconciliation with him; for then we have Peace with our ſelves, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and Quietneſs of Soul, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him as to our Father for all we want, and Hope and Aſſurance of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, which will make the Comforts of our Life ſafe, and the Afflictions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of eaſie, and the End and Diſſolution
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152948:18"/>thereof Comfortable. 2. In <hi>the life to come,</hi> the fulneſs of fruition of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Goodneſs, Glory, and Preſence of God, according to the uttermoſt meaſure and capacity of our faculties, which in the Reſurrection ſhall be great and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and this is called the <hi>Beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Why</hi> this is part of the Chief End of Man? Becauſe this is the Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs of Man to injoy God; and <hi>nothing beſides can make him Happy,</hi> which appears, 1. in all <hi>other injoyments,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the injoyment of God, there is a great deal of <hi>Vanity and emptineſs,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Pleaſures, or Profits, or worldly Advantages: Men expect great matters from them, but after a little injoyment of them, they are weary and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſappointed, and that there is not that comfort in them that they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then they travel to ſome other worldly injoyment, and there they find the like. This therefore cannot afford Man his Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In all other injoyments without God, there is a great deal of <hi>Vexation and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> The Cares, and Fears, and Sorrows, and Diſappointments, that we meet with in the injoyment of them, doth out weigh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152948:18"/>all the Contentment and Benefit that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in them; and therefore this cannot be our Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All other injoyments without God <hi>have their End and Term:</hi> Sometimes we over live them; the Pleaſures and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of youth leave us when we are old: And ſometimes we ſee our Riches, our Health, our Earthly Comforts taken from us; but, if not, yet when we die, we leave them; and yet our Souls continue after death; and our Bodies and Souls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue after our Reſurrection for ever. The injoyments therefore of this Life, cannot be our Happineſs; but that Happineſs which continues as long as we continue; which is the injoyment of the Favor, Love, and Preſence of God for ever.</p>
                     <p>Now put <hi>both together.</hi> The Glorifying of God, and the injoyment of him for ever, is the Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs of Man, the <hi>Chief End</hi> for which he was made. Such is the Goodneſs and Bounty of God, that he doth not only injoyn Man his Duty to Glorifie him, but alſo joyns with it Mans Happineſs to injoy him for ever: He that obſerves the former, ſhall be ſure not to miſs of the latter: In the ſame path and tract which leads us to Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, which is our Duty, we are ſure
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152948:19"/>to meet with our injoyment of him, which is our everlaſting Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs: And the buſineſs of the true Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is to lead us to that Duty, and to that Happineſs which is the Chief End of Man: He that wants this, will be miſerable in the midſt of all worldly Enjoyments; and he that attains this, his Comforts here ſhall be bleſſed, his Croſſes Sanctified, and his Death a gate to let him into a moſt Bleſſed and Glorious and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</p>

                     <head>Theſis II. <hi>The Scriptures of both Teſtaments are the only perfect Rule for Mans attaining his Chief End.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>This is the End, why Man was made, and which he ought principally to attend and look after; but becauſe to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the End, it is neceſſary that <hi>the due means</hi> of attaining thereof, be known and uſed: And becauſe, as Almighty God, the Maker of Man, is he that alone muſt deſign the End of his own Work, ſo likewiſe it belongs to him alone to chuſe and appoint and order the means belonging to that end; therefore, as he is not wanting to us in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152948:19"/>a Fit and Bleſſed End to Mankind, ſo neither is he wanting in deſigning and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering unto Mankind the Means for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that End.</p>
                     <p>This means is called a <hi>Rule,</hi> a fixed and ſetled direction, teaching and ſhewing us what is to be known, and what to be done and avoided, in order to that end, Beaſts follow inſtincts of Nature in their actions: But Man, that is indued with higher facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ordered to a better End, is to be directed to that End by a Rule given by that God, who hath appointed his End. <hi>This Rule</hi> therefore that muſt guide Man to his great End of his Creation, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it be a <hi>Rule given by God himſelf:</hi> For as he appoints the End of Mankind, ſo he alone muſt appoint the Means of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and therefore the diſcovery thereof muſt come from him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it be a <hi>certain Rule,</hi> in reſpect of the great conſequence that depends upon it, Mans everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it be a <hi>fixed and ſetled Rule;</hi> for Mankind is apt to ſtraggle and wander, full of vain imaginations, which, were not the Rule fixed and ſtable, would corrupt and diſorder it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A <hi>plain and eaſie Rule;</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152948:20"/>all Men, as well the unlearned and weak, as the wiſe and learned; their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is equal, and therefore the Rule, that tends to that common concernment, is fit to be plain and familiar.</p>
                     <p>Since it is neceſſary therefore that there ſhould be a Rule, and ſuch a Rule, we are to conſider whether God hath afforded ſuch a Rule, and <hi>what it is,</hi> which is ſet down in theſe three particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God hath given his own Word to be this Rule.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are that Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That thoſe Scriptures are the Rule, and the only Rule, whereby Man may attain his Chief End.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God hath given us his own Word to be this Rule. And this, as before appears, was neceſſary that the Direction to our Chief End ſhould come from God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Herein is to be obſerved. 1. <hi>What thoſe Scriptures are</hi> They are the Canonical Books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> excluding the Books commonly called <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> Theſe were written in ſeveral Ages by holy Men inſpired with the Spirit of God. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Some parts thereof, as the Five Books of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152948:20"/>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> above Three thouſand five hundred years ſince; and that of the <hi>New Testament</hi> above One thouſand ſix hundred years ſince. And <hi>Almighty God,</hi> who hath had a moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of the Everlaſting Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, hath by a wonderful Providence hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to preſerved them uncorrupted, and hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed them over all Nations in their ſeveral Languages, that as the common Salvation concerned all Men, ſo the means of attaining it, might be likewiſe common to all Men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Why the Divine Providence hath ordered it to be put into Writing?</hi> It is true, in the firſt Ages of the World, till the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was near Three thouſand five hundred years, the Will of God was not put into wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but was delivered over by word of mouth, from Father to Son. And this was the direction that Men had to know and to obey God. 1. Becauſe in thoſe ancient Ages of the World, Men lived long: For <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Man, lived above Twenty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> the eighth from <hi>Adam,</hi> was born; and <hi>Methuſalem</hi> lived almoſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after <hi>Sem</hi> was born; and <hi>Sem</hi> lived above ſixty years after <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born. So that in theſe three Men, <hi>Adam, Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and <hi>Sem,</hi> all the Truths of God for above Two thouſand years were preſerved and delivered over. 2. Becauſe the ſelect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152948:21"/>Churhes of God were preſerved in Families, and were not National; and ſo the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God kept in a ſmaller compaſs.</p>
                     <p>But when after the Ages of Men were ſhorter, and when the Church of God grew to be National, as it was after the <hi>Jews</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then God himſelf wrote his Law in Tables of Stone, and <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote his Five Books: And then, and from that time forward, the Sacred Hiſtories and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the Goſpel, and other parts of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was committed to Writing, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons principally.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they might be the better preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from being loſt or forgotten.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they might be the better preſerved from being corrupted: For that which is delivered only by word of Mouth, is many times varied and changed in the ſecond or third hand.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it might be the better diſperſed and communicated to all Mankind. And this was done in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> by Tranſlations of it into <hi>Greek,</hi> about two hundred years before Chriſt, and diſperſing it into a great part of the World: And after Chriſts time, both the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Tranſlated into ſeveral Languages,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152948:21"/>and ſince diſperſed over the World; which could not have been ſo well done, had it not been at firſt in Writing.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Wiſdom and Providence of God provides for the exigence of all times moſt wiſely and excellently: And having preſerved part of this precious Jewel, the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> for the moſt part, within the Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> till it was broken, about the time of Chriſt, by the <hi>Romans,</hi> hath now delivered both to all Mankind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is to be inquired,
<note place="margin">Which the Author hath elſwhere more largely conſidered.</note> 
                        <hi>What evidence we have to prove thoſe Writings to be the Word of God.</hi> And omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many others, we inſiſt upon theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Writings of Men, eſpecially when written by ſeveral Men at ſeveral times, their Writings do ſeldom or never agree, but differ and croſs one another. And the reaſon is, becauſe they are written by ſeveral Men, who are all guided by ſeveral Minds and Judgments. But the Scriptures, though written by ſeveral Men in ſeveral Ages, many unacquainted with one anothers Writings, yet they all <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>ſpeak</hi> the ſame Truth; which is an evidence that it was One and the ſame Spirit that did dictate them.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:152948:22"/>
                     <p n="2">2. It is not poſſible for any Man, without Revelation from God, to foretel things to come. Now theſe holy Writings <hi>foretold things that most certainly came to paſs</hi> in their ſeveral ſeaſons, though many Generations after the Propheſie written; therefore they were written by Inſpiration from God. As for inſtance, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, and the Deliverance from it, by <hi>Jeremy;</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, by <hi>Daniel;</hi> the Birth and Death of Chriſt; the final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Diſperſion of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Matter contained in theſe holy Writings is that of the greateſt importance; the Will of God concerning Man, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Creation of the World by God; of aſſurance of the Life to come; of the means of Peace between God and Man. Theſe are things of the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in the World, yet things which could never be diſcovered but by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſuch as never any writings of Men only, ever could diſcover, or durſt pretend unto: The height, and rarity, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and weight of the matter of theſe Books do evidence, that they were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of God to Man, and by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence committed to writing and delivered
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152948:22"/>over to Mankind, as the Rule to attain their Chief End.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As the Rule to attain our Chief End muſt come from God; and as the Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are the Word of God; ſo we ſay, <hi>That theſe Scriptures</hi> are the Rule, and <hi>the only Rule</hi> to attain our Chief End. Good Books of other Men, good Education, good Sermons, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Church are good helps; but there is no other Rule but this. It is by this Rule we muſt try other Mens Books and Sermons, yea, the very Church it ſelf. Thus the <hi>Bereans</hi> tried the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves, by the Scriptures which they then had, and are commended for it. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. And <hi>Peter</hi> prefers the evidence of the Scriptures before a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. And Chriſt himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Scriptures to juſtifie himſelf and his Doctrine. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. And if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be the only Rule,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then not a Natural Conſcience, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as the caſe now ſtands with Mankind; for that is many times corrupted and falſe principled, puts good for evil, and evil for good: It is, and may be a great help, guide, and direction, not a perfect Rule.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then not the Writings and Traditions of Men: God that appoints the End, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152948:23"/>Means muſt be the diſcoverer of the Means of our Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then not pretended Revelations; thoſe may be Mens imaginations, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils deluſions; to prevent and diſcover which, God hath ſet up this great and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation of his Scriptures.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then not the Church, for that may err, and it hath no way to evidence it ſelf but by the Scriptures, which are its Foundation.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs of Mans Salvation is of that importance, and the Wiſdom of God ſo great, that he will not commit ſo weighty a matter to ſuch uncertain Rules as theſe, but hath provided one of his own making, the Holy Scriptures.</p>

                     <head>Theſis III. <hi>The Principal Subject of the Scriptures is what Man is to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of Man.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>It is the Principal Subject of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 1. Becauſe it is of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and concernment. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Let us hear the concluſion of the whole matter, Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of Man.</hi> Fear God, which cannot be without the knowledge of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152948:23"/>him, and keep his Commandments, which contains his duty of Obedience to him. 2. Becauſe all the other Matters of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have a kind of dependance upon, and connexion with this Principal Matter or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>But though this be the Principal Matter or Subject of the Scriptures, yet they alſo contain very many <hi>other matters,</hi> that do very much concern us to know and believe; as namely, What we are to underſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſelves, the State of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Fall of Man, the State wherein that Fall hath put all Mankind, the means of our recovery, the Immortality of the Soul, the Reſurrection, the different eſtate of the good and bad after death, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church and Houſhold of God, from the Creation of Man, till ſome thirty years after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and divers other and neceſſary Matters to be known both for our direction, inſtruction, and comfort.</p>
                     <p>And as the Scriptures do principally teach the Knowledge of Good, and our duty, as the principal Subject, ſo they do principally teach it above other teachings or means. It is true, that the very Light of Nature doth teach us much of what is to be known con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and our duty to him: As
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152948:24"/>namely, that there is a God, and that there is but one God; that this God is the firſt Cauſe, and alſo the preſerver of all things, That he is Eternal, without beginning or end, Infinite, Spiritual without mixture, moſt Perfect; and therefore moſt free, moſt Powerful, moſt Holy, moſt Wiſe, moſt Juſt, moſt Bountiful and Merciful. And upon all theſe Grounds, the Light of Nature teacheth that he is to be Honored, to be Feared, to be Worſhipped, to be Obeyed. This the Apoſtle ſhews us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the Inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead, ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> And this light of Nature gives this Manifeſtation of God, 1. By the Works of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. 2. By the Workings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 3. By a Traditional delivery over of ſome truths from man to man, which by the ſtudy and pains of ſome wiſe men and Law-givers, raiſed up by the Providence of God, have been perfected and delivered over to others.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Preheminence of the Scriptures</hi> in their inſtruction of Mankind in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and his duty to God, appears partly in theſe conſiderations.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:152948:24"/>
                     <p n="1">1. The knowledge the Scriptures give in theſe things, is more eaſie to be attained; becauſe it ſets down theſe truths plainly, that the moſt ordinary capacity may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: Whereas the knowledge of theſe things by the Light of Nature, is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, requires much obſervation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and attention, deducing and drawing down one thing from another, and ſo arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at their knowledge by much pains and ſtudy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The knowledge of theſe things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Scripture is much <hi>more full and perfect,</hi> than that knowledge which can be attained by the Light of Nature; as appears in theſe two reſpects. 1. Thoſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, that the Light of Nature doth in ſome meaſure diſcover, are more fully, compleatly and clearly diſcovered by the Light of the Scriptures. 2. The Scriptures do diſcover thoſe things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and his Works, and our ſelves, that were never diſcovered, nor indeed diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, by the Light of Nature, which as they are of greateſt importance to be known; ſo being diſcovered by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they do wonderfully clear and ſatisfie the defects of the Light of Nature. As for inſtance in both kinds; the Light of Nature diſcovers that there is a God; but the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152948:25"/>manner of his ſubſiſtence in Three Perſons, yet in Unity of Eſſence, is only learned by the Scriptures. The Light of Nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, that he is the firſt Cauſe and Preſerver of all things; but the manner how all things were produced, and when, is only learned by the Scriptures. The Light of Nature tells us, that this God is to be worſhipped and obeyed; but in what manner he is to be worſhipped, and the particulars of his commands wherein he is to be obeyed, it diſcoves not, or, at leaſt, very darkly: The Scriptures only ſhew us clearly the manner of his worſhip, and the certain Rule of our Obedience. The Light of Nature ſhews us, that there is a great defection and diſorder in our Natures; but whence it did ariſe, or how it is to be helped, the Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth. The Light of Nature ſhews us, that all Sin is an offence againſt the Purity, Juſtice, and Will of God, and therefore deſerves his anger and diſpleaſure; but how the guilt of Sin may be done away, and the favor of God again procured, is not within the reach of the Light of Nature to diſcover, but is only learned from the Scriptures. The Light of Nature teacheth, that ſurely there is a Reward for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and a puniſhment of the obſtinate ſinner; but how it ſhall be inflicted, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152948:25"/>when, and how Mankind ſhould be put into a capacity of receiving Rewards or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by Reſurrection from the Dead, the Light of Nature diſcovers not, or, at leaſt, but darkly and diffidently and confuſedly; the Light of the Scriptures only diſcovers all plainly, clearly, and evidently. Theſe and divers other Truths are diſcovered in the Scriptures, which the Light of Nature, either not at all, or if at all, yet but darkly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Light of Nature is very uncertain and eaſily corrupted, either by luſts, or weakneſs, or variety of Imaginations. And from hence grew all the falſe gods, falſe worſhips, idolatries, and ſuperſititions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen that were only led by the Light of Nature, changing the Truth of God into a lie, and changing the Glory of the Incorruptible God into an Image made like to a corruptible man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23, 25. But the Light of the Scriptures is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, ſtable, fixed Light,</hi> not adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor to be corrupted, but though Mens imaginations and fancies, be as unſtable as the Waters, and thereby corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themſelves, yet the Light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures continue firm and ſtable, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſucceſſions of thouſands of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:152948:26"/>
                     <p>Now <hi>the things that the Scriptures thus principally teach,</hi> are two, in order to the two great Powers, or Faculties of Man. 1. In order to his Underſtanding, what is to be believed, and to be believed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally touching God. 2. In order to his Will, or practical faculty, What God requires to be done.</p>
                     <p>As touching the former, What is to be believed? <hi>Believing, and knowledge, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, differ in this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowledge</hi> is that whereby we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know any thing to be, or nor to be by our Senſes, or Reaſon, or Experience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Opinion</hi> is a doubtful uncertain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of mind that any thing is, or is not; yet not without a mixture of doubting or diſtruſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Belief</hi> is a certain perſwaſion of the truth of any thing upon the Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of another. Now if we be aſſured, that whatſoever God ſaith, is moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, (as needs it muſt be, becauſe Truth is an eſſential Attribute of God,) and if we be perſwaded ſurely, that theſe Scriptures are the Word of God, then of neceſſity we muſt believe whatſoever Almighty God in the Scriptures reveals: And this is Belief. So that the very ſame Truth that may be known by Reaſon or Obſervation, may
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152948:26"/>likewiſe be believed as revealed in the Word of God. Though many things are to be believed, becauſe revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which cannot be fully demonſtrated by Reaſon. Thus though it be partly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Reaſon that God made the World, and ſo is the object of our knowledge; yet the ſame Truth, as revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is to be believed, and ſo is the object of our Faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Through Faith we underſtand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God;</hi> that is, We do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and ſubſcribe unto it as true, becauſe God in the Scriptures, which are his Word, hath revealed and diſcovered it unto us.</p>
                     <p>And as touching things to be done, the duty God requires of us, here is the <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the performance of duties,</hi> by a Man believing the Scriptures, and another Man. A Believer doth a good work, (for example, a Work of Mercy) and a Heathen, or another Moral Man, doth the ſame work; and yet though the work be, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſame, they very much differ in the value: The Believer underſtands by the Word of God, that it is a duty injoyned him of God, to be merciful, as <hi>our Father who is in Heaven is merciful;</hi> he believes it to be the command of God, and he doth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152948:27"/>it in obedience to that command, and ſo it is accepted of God; but another Man many times doth it, or may do it not upon the ſame account, but it may be meerly upon the inclination of his natural temper, or for vain-glory; and ſo it is not ſo much an act of obedience to God, as love to himſelf. And therefore in the former, it is the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> in the latter, an Action of Nature.</p>

                     <hi>TWo things</hi> are principally <hi>commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to us in this Text. 1. A <hi>Duty</hi> injoyned, to remember our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. 2. The principal <hi>Seaſon</hi> of that Duty, <hi>The days of our Youth.</hi> Which Seaſon is recommended for this duty by way of preference above <hi>the evil days;</hi> not as if the <hi>Remembring our Creator</hi> were unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at any time, but becauſe the time of our Youth is more ſeaſonable than that Evil time, or thoſe Evil days, wherein we ſhall ſay, We have no pleaſure in them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Duty</hi> injoyned, is to <hi>Remember our Creator,</hi> which imports <hi>two things.</hi> 1. To know our Creator; for we cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what we have not ſome knowledge of. 2. To Remember him, often to call him to mind.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:152948:28"/>
                  <p n="1">1. The former part of this Duty is to <hi>Know our Creator.</hi> This is that which aged <hi>David</hi> commended to his young Son <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>And thou</hi> Solomon, <hi>my Son, Know thou the God of thy Father.</hi> And we have <hi>Two excellent Books,</hi> wherein the Knowledge of God is diſcovered to us; the <hi>Book of his Works,</hi> the Works of his Creation and Providence; and the <hi>Book of his Word,</hi> contained in the Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> wherein he is more fully, and explicitly, and plainly diſcovered unto us: Theſe Books we are often to read and conſider. And this is the chief reaſon, why Underſtanding and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given unto Mankind, and not unto the <hi>Beaſts that periſh,</hi> namely, that we might improve it to the attaining of the Knowledge of Almighty God, in the due conſideration of the Works and Word of God; and hereby we learn his Eternity, his Infiniteneſs, his Wiſdom, his Power, his Goodneſs, his Juſtice, his Mercy, his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, his Soveraignty, his Providence, his Will, his Purpoſe concerning Mankind, his Care of them, his Beneficence towards them. And <hi>the Nature of this Knowledge</hi> is not barely Speculative, but it is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is Operative; that perfects our Nature; that conforms it to the Image of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152948:28"/>that God we thus know; that ſets Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in its due ſtate and ſtation; keeps it in its juſt ſubordination unto the God we thus know, which is our greateſt Perfection. This Knowledge muſt neceſſarily make us love him, becauſe he is Good, Merciful, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, Beneficent; and therefore the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> chuſeth to expreſs him by that Title of <hi>Creator,</hi> from whom we receive our very Being, and all the good that can accompany it. This Knowledge teacheth us to be thankful unto him, as our Greateſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; to depend upon him, becauſe of his Power and Goodneſs; to fear him, becauſe of his Power and Juſtice; to obey him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Power, Juſtice and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to walk before him in Sincerity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Power, Juſtice, and Wiſdom. In ſum, the ſeveral Attributes of Almighty God do ſtrike upon the choiceſt parts, and faculties, and affections, and tendencies of our Hearts and Souls, and do tune them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that order and harmony that is beſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the perfecting of our Nature, and the placing of them in a right and juſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, both in relation to Almighty God, our ſelves, and others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of our Duty is, To <hi>Remember our Creator</hi> thus known; which is to have the Senſe and Exerciſe of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152948:29"/>always about us; to ſet Almighty God always before our eyes, frequently to think of him, to make our application to him: For many there are that may have a knowledge of God, but yet the exerciſe of that knowledge is ſuſpended; ſometimes by Inadvertence and Inconſiderateneſs; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a wilful Abdication of the exerciſe of that Knowledge. And theſe are ſuch as forget God, that have not God in all their thoughts, that ſay to the Almighty, Depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Benefits of this Remembring our Creator,</hi> are very great: 1. It keeps the Soul and Life in a conſtant, and true, and regular frame. As the want of the Knowledge, ſo the want of the Remembrance of God, is the cauſe of that diſorder and irregularity of our minds and lives. 2. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beſt Preventive of Sin, and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Backſliding from God and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him. 3. It keeps the Mind and Soul full of conſtant Peace and Tranquillity; becauſe it maintains a conſtant, humble, and comfortable converſe of the Soul, with the Preſence and Favor of God. 4. It rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers all conditions of life comfortable, and full of contentment; becauſe it keeps the Soul in the preſence of God, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152948:29"/>unto it continual Influxes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and Comfort; for what can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb him, who, by the continual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Creator, hath the conſtant acquaintance with his Power, Goodneſs, and Alſufficiency? 5. Though no Man hath ground enough to promiſe to himſelf an Immunity from Temporal Calamities, yet certainly there is no better expedient in the World to ſecure a Man againſt them, and preſerve him from them than this: For, the moſt part of thoſe ſharp Afflictions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal Men, are but to make them Remember their Creator when they have forgotten him, that he may open their ears to Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and awake them to Remember their Creator, Read <hi>Job</hi> 33. A Man that keeps about him the Remembrance of his Creator, prevents in a great meaſure the neceſſity of that ſevere Diſcipline. 6. In ſhort this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our Creator is an Antidote againſt the Allurements of the World; the Temptations of Satan; the deceitfulneſs of Sin. It renders the beſt things the World can afford inconſiderable, in compariſon of him, whom we remember; it renders the worſt the World can do, but little and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; ſo long as we Remember our Creator, it makes our lives happy, our deaths eaſie, and carries us to an everlaſting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152948:30"/>Injoyment of that Creator, whom we have here remembred.</p>
                  <p>The Injunction of the Duty of <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring our Creator,</hi> is the more <hi>importantly neceſſary.</hi> 1. In regard of the great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the benefit we receive from it, as before. 2. In regard of the great danger of omitting it. The truth is, the greateſt part of the miſcarriages of our lives, are occaſioned by the want of the remembrance of our Creator; then it is that we fail in our Duty, when we forget him. 3. In regard of the many Temptations this World affords to make us forget our Creator; the Pleaſures, and Profits, and Recreations, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Noiſe, and Buſineſs of this Life; yea, many of them, which are in themſelves, and in their Nature lawful, are apt to ingroſs our Thoughts, our Time, our Cares, and to leave too little room in our memory for this great Duty that moſt deſerves it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The Remembrance of our Creator.</hi> Our memory is a noble Cabinet, and there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more excellent Jewel to lodge in (it) than our Great and Bountiful Creator; yet for the moſt part we fill this noble Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net with pebles and ſtraws, if not with dung and filth; with either ſinful, or, at leaſt, with Unprofitable, Impertinent, Trifling Furniture.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:152948:30"/>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Seaſon</hi> for this Duty, that is here principally commended, is, <hi>The days of our Youth.</hi> And the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that commend that Seaſon for this Duty are principally theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this is the moſt <hi>Accepted Time.</hi> God Almighty was pleaſed under the <hi>Old Law</hi> to intimate this, in (the) reſervation to himſelf of the firſt fruits, and the firſt born. And ſurely, the firſt fruits of our Lives, when dedicated to his remembrance, are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe this Seaſon is commonly our <hi>Turning Seaſon</hi> to Good or Evil. And if in Youth we forget our Creator, it is very great difficulty to reſume our Duty: Commonly it requires either very extraordinary Grace, or very ſtrong Affliction, to reclaim a Man to his Duty, whoſe Youth hath been ſeaſoned with ill Principles, and the Forgetfulneſs of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the time of Youth is moſt <hi>Obnoxious to forget God;</hi> there is great Inadvertency and Inconſiderateneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy, Unſtableneſs, Vanity, Love of Pleaſures, Eaſineſs to be corrupted in Youth; and therefore neceſſary in this ſeaſon to lodge the Remembrance of our Creator in our Youth, to be an Antidote againſt theſe defects, to eſtabliſh and fix the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152948:31"/>entrance of our lives with this great Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, the Remembrance of our Creator.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Almighty God lays hold of our Youth, by a timely Remembrance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thereby takes the firſt poſſeſſion of our Souls, commonly it keeps its ground, and ſeaſons the whole courſe of our enſuing Lives; it prevents and anticipates the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the World. It is true, it may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be, that Natural Corruption and Worldly Temptations may ſuſpend the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Principle, but it is rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed: It is like that abiding ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in him: ſpoken of by <hi>John.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. Which will recover him again.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The laſt reaſon is becauſe there are <hi>Evil Days</hi> that <hi>will certainly come,</hi> which will render this work of Remembring our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator difficult to be firſt begun: and therefore it is the greateſt Prudence imaginable to lay in this ſtock, before they come, for it will certainly ſtand us in great ſtead when they come. It is the greateſt Imprudence in the World to defer that buſineſs, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be done, unto ſuch a time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is very difficult to be done: and it is the greateſt Prudence in the World to do that work, which muſt be done, in ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherein it may be eaſily and ſafely done. He that lays in this ſtore of Remembrance of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152948:31"/>his Creator before the Evil Day come, will find it of the greateſt uſe and ſervice to him in that Evil Day.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe <hi>Evil Days</hi> are many, and all of them befall ſome, but ſome of them will certainly befall all Mankind.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An Evil Day of Publick or Private <hi>Calamities.</hi> He that beforehand hath laid in this ſtock of Remembring his Creator, will be eaſily able to bear any Calamity when it comes; but a man, that hath not done this before hand, will find it a very unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time to begin to ſet about it, when Fear, and Anguiſh, and Perplexity, and Storms, and Confuſion are round about him, and take up all his thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Evil Day of <hi>Sickneſs</hi> is an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time, or at leaſt a very difficult time, to begin ſuch a buſineſs. When Sickneſs, and Pain, and Diſorder, and uneaſineſs ſhall render a man Impatient and full of Trouble, and his Thoughts full of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and Diſcompoſure, and Wayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then it will be found a difficult buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to begin the Remembrance of our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. It is true, no time is utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable of God for this work, but ſurely it is beſt to begin before this Evil day come, for then it will be a comfort and mitigate the Pains and Diſcompoſure of Sickneſs,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152948:32"/>when a man can thus reflect upon his life paſt, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did in his Sickneſs; <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, O Lord, that I have</hi> not failed to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Creator in the days of my Health.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The evil Day of <hi>Old and Infirm Age,</hi> which is a Diſeaſe and burthen of it ſelf, and yet is ever accompanied with other Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Pains and Diſeaſes, and a Natural frowardneſs, and Moroſity, and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs of mind, and therefore not ſo ſeaſonable to begin the undertaking of this work as the flouriſhing Youth. And indeed, a man cannot reaſonably expect that the Great God, who invites the Remembring our Creator in the Days of our Youth, and hath been ungratefully denied, ſhould accept the Dreggs of our Age for a Sacrifice, when we have neglected the thoughts of him in our ſtrong and flouriſhing age. But on the other ſide, that man, that hath ſpent the time of his Youth and Strength in the remembrance of his Creator, may with comfort and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his old and feeble age, reflect upon his paſt life with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>O Lord, I pray thee, that I have not failed to remember thee in the days of my Youth and Strength, and I pray thee accept of the endeavours of my Old Decayed Age to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Remembrance of thee, which I ſo early began, and have conſtantly continued,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152948:32"/>and pardon the defects, that the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays of my ſtrength and age have occaſioned in that duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The evil day <hi>of Death:</hi> when my Soul fits hovering upon my lips and is ready to take its flight, when all the World cannot give my Life any certain truce for a day, or for an hour, and I am under the cold em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of Death, then to begin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Creator is a difficult and unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time: But when I have began that buſineſs early, and held on the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my Creator, it will be a Cordial even againſt Death it ſelf, and will carry my Soul unto the Preſence of that God, which I have thus remembred in and from the days of my Youth, with Triumph and Rejoycing.</p>
                  <p>Briefly therefore:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth; becauſe thou knoweſt not whether thou ſhalt have any other Seaſon to Remember him: Death may overtake thee, and lay thee in the Land of Forgetfulneſs: thy Spring may be thy Autumn, and thy early bud may be the only fruit that Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may afford thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth; becauſe it is a time of Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: neglect not this Seaſon, becauſe thou
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152948:33"/>knoweſt not whether ever thou ſhalt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain invited to it.</p>
                  <p>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth, that thy Creator may remember thee, in the days of thy Sickneſs, and Old Age, and in the Evil Day.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth, leſt thy Creator neglect thee in the Evil Day. Neglected Favours, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from thy God, may juſtly provoke him never to lend thee more; <hi>Becauſe I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ye refuſed, I alſo will laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh.</hi> Prov. 1.24, 26.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth, becauſe it will heal the Evil of Evil days, when they come; it will turn thoſe days, that are in themſelves Evil, to become days of Eaſe and Comfort; it will heal the Evil of the day of Affliction, of Sickneſs, of Old Age, and of Death it ſelf, and make it a paſſage into a better, a more abiding Life.</p>

What is the condition of a Heart thus cleanſed, or wherein the cleanneſs of the Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. If the Heart muſt be created a new, before it can be a clean Heart; Certainly, before it is thus new formed, is is an Impure and <hi>unclean Heart.</hi> And this, that is here
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152948:34"/>implyed, is frequently in the Scriptures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly affirmed: Gen. 7.5. <hi>The imagination of the thoughts of the Heart of Man is only Evil continually:</hi> Jer. 17.9. <hi>The Heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> Mark 7.21. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed all the Evils that are in the World, are but evidences of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of the Heart, that unclean Fountain and Original of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Concerning the ſecond; wherein <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs</hi> of the Heart conſiſts. The Heart is indeed the <hi>Craſis,</hi> or Collection of all the Powers of the Soul in the full extent of it; and therefore takes in not only the Will and Affections, but the Underſtanding and Conſcience, and accordingly hath its Denomination proper to thoſe ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as a Wiſe Heart, a Fooliſh Heart, a Believing Heart, an Unbelieving Heart, an Hard Heart, a Soft Heart, and the like. But anſwerable to the propriety of the <hi>Epithete,</hi> Clean or Unclean, it principally concerns the Heart under the notion of Will or Deſire, and the Conſequents that are thereupon; and conſequently according to the propriety of Application; a <hi>Clean Heart</hi> is ſuch a Heart as hath Clean Deſires and Affections; <hi>an unclean Heart</hi> is that which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152948:34"/>hath unclean and impure Deſires, a Heart full of evil Concupiſcence. And becauſe the Cleanneſs or Uncleanneſs of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are denominated from their Objects, and not from the Affections or Deſires them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which are diverſified according to their Objects; Hence it is that a Heart, that fixeth her Deſires upon pure and clean Objects, is ſaid in that act <hi>to be</hi> a Clean Heart, and that which fixeth its Deſires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Unclean or Impure Objects is an Unclean Heart in that Act: Therefore, before we can determine what an Unclean Heart is, it is neceſſary to know what are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Objects,</hi> the tendency of the Deſires of the Heart whereunto doth denominate an Unclean Heart. Generally whatſoever is a thing prohibited by the Command of GOd, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it an <hi>Immundities,</hi> an Impurity and Uncleanneſs in it: But that is not the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs principally intended; it is more Large and Spacious than the intent of the Text bears: But there are certain Luſts and Impure or Immoderate Propenſions in our Natures after certain Objects, which come under the name of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Luſts;</hi> and thoſe are of two kinds: the Luſts of the Mind, and the Luſts of the Fleſh: for ſo they are called and diſtinguiſhed by the Apoſtle. <hi>The Luſts of the Mind</hi> are ſuch as have their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152948:35"/>Activity principally in the Mind, though they may have their Improvements by the <hi>Craſis</hi> and Conſtitution of the Body: as the Luſts of Envy, Revenge, Hatred, Pride, Vain-glory. Theſe are more Spiritual Luſts; and therefore though they are more Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, yet they are not properly ſo Unclean, as thoſe we after mention. <hi>The Luſts of the Fleſh</hi> are ſuch Luſts, as ariſe from our ſenſual Appetites after ſenſual Objects; as the Luſts after Meats, Drink, and Carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. And though theſe Objects are not in themſelves ſinful, nor conſequently the Appetites of them unlawful, (for they are planted in our Natures, by the Wiſe and Pure God of Nature, to moſt neceſſary and excellent Ends; for the Preſervation of our ſelves and our Kind;) yet they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently become Impurities and Uncleanneſs to us, when inordinately Affected or Acted. And theſe are thoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Objects,</hi> the Deſires whereof do denominate an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Heart;</hi> but principally the Latter, the Luſt of Carnal Concupiſcence, called by the Scriptures in an eminent manner <hi>the Lust of the Fleſh,</hi> 1 John 2.16. <hi>Fleſhly Luſts, that fight againſt the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. <hi>Walking after the Fleſh in the Luſts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10. Perchance bearing ſome Analogy to thoſe Legal Uncleanneſſes in the Levitical
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152948:35"/>Law, eſpecially to thoſe of <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. Even the very natural Infirmities; nay, thoſe that are not only tolerated, but allowed, carry in them a kind of Impurity and Uncleanneſs. And hence grow thoſe many Legal Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which diſabled the <hi>Jews</hi> from coming into the Camp or Tabernacle till they were Purified, as that of Leproſie, touching of dead bodies, unclean iſſues, uncleanneſs after Child-birth, uncleanneſs of natural Commixtions, <hi>Lev.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Exodus</hi> 19.15. The uncleanneſs of natural Seceſſions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.13, 14. The waſhings of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.20. All which are but Emblems of the Impurity of the Heart, and of the great Care that is to be uſed in the keeping of it Clean: and the Reaſon is Morally and Excellently given, Deut. 23.14. <hi>For the Lord thy God walketh in the midſt of the Camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine Enemies before thee: therefore ſhall thy Camp be Holy, that he ſee no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion therefore is, that this Carnal Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, the Luſt of the Fleſh, predominate in the Heart, is that which principally and by way of Eminence, in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of it, denominates an Unclean Heart. But in as much as this Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence hath ſomewhat in it, that is natural,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152948:36"/>and conſequently is not ſimply of it ſelf Sin or Uncleanneſs; therefore it is requiſite to give a denomination of Uncleanneſs and Impurity to thoſe deſires, that there be ſome Formalities requiſite to the denomination of this to be Unclean and Sinful, which is, when thoſe Deſires are not in ſubjection to right Reaſon; for it being a proceed of the inferior Faculties, the ſenſual Appetite, when the ſame is not in ſubordination to that Empire which God hath given the more Heavenly and Noble Powers of the Soul; it becomes Confuſion and inverting of the order of Nature; and this is principally <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi> when theſe Deſires are. 1. Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. 2. Unſeaſonable. 3. Without their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end. 4. Irregular. 5. Unruly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bridle of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this Uncleanneſs of the Heart, are principally theſe two: 1. The Impetuouſneſs, and continual ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the ſenſual Appetite, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſends up its foul Exhalations and Steems into the Heart, and thereby taints and infects it. The Soul of Man is like a kind of Fire, which if it be fed with clean and ſweet materials, it yields ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Fumes; but if it be fed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and unclean, and ſtinking oyl and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, it is tainted with them, and makes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152948:36"/>unſavory thoughts, which are a kind of Fume that riſe from this Fire; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the diſtemper of the Body, or ſenſual Appetite ſend up cholerick Steems into this ſacred Fire, it yields nothing but thoughts of Anger and Indignation: If it ſends up Melancholy and Earthy fumes, it fills the Soul with black, and diſmal, and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts: If it ſend up, as moſt ordinarily it doth, ſenſual and fleſhly Steems, it fills the Heart with ſenſual and wanton thoughts. 2. The Weakneſs and Defect of the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of the Soul, the Reaſon, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and this Defect is commonly upon theſe two occaſions. 1. The Soul wants a clear Senſe and Judgment, that theſe Deſires are not fit to be gratified, but to be denied, at leaſt, when they become Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate or Unſeaſonable. It is ordinarily our Infirmity to judge of things as they are at preſent; and therefore if the Preſent preſents it ſelf pleaſing or diſpleaſing, we accordingly entertain it, or refuſe it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any due proſpect to the event or ſtate of things at a diſtance; either becauſe we Know it not, or Believe it not, or Regard it not. If a Man, being ſolicited to unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable or unſeaſonable carnal Pleaſures, hath not a proſpect that the end thereof will be bitterneſs; or, if he have ſuch a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152948:37"/>Proſpect, yet he believes it not; or if he do, yet if his Judgment prefer the ſatisfaction of a preſent Luſt, before the avoiding of an endleſs pain, it is no wonder if he ſubmit to the ſolicitation of his ſenſual Appetite. 2. But if the Judgment be right, yet if the Superiour and more noble part of the Soul have not Courage and Reſolution enough to give the Law to the Inferiour, but yields, and ſubmits, and becomes baſe, the ſenſual Appetite gets the throne and Captivates Reaſon, and rules as it pleaſeth; and this is commonly the condition of the Soul after a fall: for the ſenſual Appetite once a Victor, becomes Imperious, and Emaſculates and Captivates the ſuperior Faculty to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Subjection. And this is the Reaſon why, when Luſts of any kind, eſpecially that of the Fleſh, having gotten the Maſtery, makes a Man indued with Reaſon and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet infinitely more Intemperate and Impure than the very Beaſts themſelves, which have no ſuch Check or Advantage of Reaſon: for thoſe noble Faculties of Phantaſie and Imagination, and Memory, and Reaſon it ſelf, being proſtituted to Luſt, doth bring in all the Advantages of its own perfection to that ſervice, and thereby ſins beyond the extent of a bare ſenſual Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the very Reaſon it ſelf invents new
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152948:37"/>and prodigious Luſts, and Proviſions for them, and fulfillings of them; the Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie improves them; the Heart and Thoughts feed upon them; and ſo by that very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature, which was placed in him to Command and Regulate theſe Luſts or Deſires of the ſenſual Appetite, becomes the moſt exquiſite and induſtrious Advancer of them, and makes a man infinitely worſe than a Beaſt: for a Beaſt hath no antecedent ſpeculations of his Luſt, no proviſions for them, but when the opportunity and his own natural propenſions encline him to them; when he hath fulfilled his Luſt, thinks no more of it: but Man, by the advantage of his Reaſon, his Phantaſie, his Memory, makes Proviſions for his Luſts; yields up his thoughts to ſpeculations of them; ſtudies ſtratagems and contrivances to ſatisfie them, So that by how much his nature is the more perfect, his ſenſual Luſts are the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and unſatiable: and by this means his Heart becomes Unclean, a very Stewes of Wantonneſs and Impurity, a box full of nothing, but ſtinking and unſavory Vapors and Steems, the very ſink &amp; receptacle of all the Impure deſires of the Fleſh, where they are cheriſhed, and entertained, and ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Impurities, more exquiſite, and yet more filthy, than ever the ſenſual Appetite
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152948:38"/>could arrive unto, and this is <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And upon theſe Conſiderations a man may eaſily ſee how little ground there is for to think there ſhould be a Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Almighty God, or his moſt Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with a man thus qualified; 1. The Heart, as it is the ſeat of the Deſires, is the only fit Sacrifice to be offered up to God; as it is the Chamber of our thoughts, it is the only fit Room to entertain him in; as it is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Actions, the fitteſt part to be aſſiſted with the Spirit of God; it is the only fit thing that we can give to God; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only thing in effect that he requires of us. 2. Again, that God is a moſt Pure God, his Spirit a moſt Pure and delicate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and let any man then judge, whether ſuch a naſty, impure, unclean Heart is a fit Sacrifice to be offered to ſuch a God; or a fit receptacle for ſuch a Spirit. It therefore imports ſuch a man, that hopes to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, to have his Heart in a better Temper. Again, it ſeems more than probable to me, that as a Body fed with poyſonous and unwholſome Food, muſt needs by ſuch a Diet contract foulneſs and putrefaction: So the very Soul of Man, which hath ſo ſtrict a Conjunction with, and union to the Body, by continual Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152948:38"/>with, and Subjection to ſuch unclean and fleſhly thoughts, receives a Tincture and an imbaſement by them; which, if there were no other Hell, muſt needs make it Miſerable in its Separation upon theſe two Reſpects: 1. Upon the Conſideration of that Uglineſs, which it hath contracted by thoſe impure Converſations, and which it might have avoided, if it had in the Body exerciſed its proper Empire over them. 2. By that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, which it finds in the State of ſeparation from the fulfilling and ſatisfying thoſe ſenſual Inclinations, which it effected here, and now carrieth with it, but ſtands utterly diſappointed of any ſatisfaction of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We conſider <hi>How</hi> it comes to paſs, that a Heart, thus naturally unclean, is <hi>Cleanſed,</hi> which in general is by a Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul to its proper and native So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Dominion over the ſenſual Appetite, and thoſe Luſts that ariſe from the Conſtitution of the Body, and the Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul to it. And this Reſtitution is anſwerable to the Depravation or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whereby the Soul is Subjected and Captivated under thoſe Luſts, which are principally theſe following:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt ground of the Impotency of the Soul, in ſubduing of the ſenſual Appetite
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152948:39"/>is in the Underſtanding, which is ſo far weakned or darkned by natural Corruption, that it is ready in point of Judgment to prefer the preſent fruition of Corporal Pleaſures, and the ſatisfaction of the ſenſual Appetite, before the denying of it; for it ſees and finds a preſent contentment in the former, but ſees not the danger and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that will inſue upon it, nor the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage that will inſue upon a due Reſtraint and Moderation of them; It finds a preſent Contentment and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the one, but it hath not the Proſpect of the other, or if it have, yet the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof is ſo Weak and Imperfect, that the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſubdue it. For the <hi>Cure</hi> therefore <hi>of this Error and Impotency</hi> in the Judgment, there ought to be: 1. A <hi>Conviction</hi> that there is a Danger and Inconvenience, that will certainly attend the Dominion of Luſt over the Soul; and a Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that will attend the Victory of the Soul over theſe Luſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And becauſe there may be an Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in the former, and a benefit in the latter, but yet not ſuch as may with Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Advantage preponderate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of Luſt, [which is preſent and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,] there ought to be a Conviction of ſuch
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152948:39"/>an Inconvenience in the former, and ſuch a Benefit in the latter, as may moſt evidently and clearly <hi>preponderate</hi> the Contentment and Advantage of the ſatisfying of a Luſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And becauſe, though theſe Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Benefits be never ſo great, yet if there be but a faint, and weak, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conviction of it, it will work but a weak reſiſtance againſt the Invaſions or Rebellions of Luſt, and a ſenſible preſent enjoyment of what delights, will eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate the weak and faint, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Convictions, or Suſpicions rather, of what is Future. It is neceſſary that ſuch Convictions, ſhould be <hi>Sound, Deep, and Strong;</hi> or otherwiſe they will be but Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh and Languiſhing opponents againſt the Rhetorick of Luſts, that yield a preſent Delight or Advantage.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And becauſe, though the Convictions are never ſo ſtrong, yet if they be not Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Conſtancy, Vigilancy, and ſupplemental Excitations, as the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires, the Conſtant and perpetual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Luſt may happen upon a time of Intermiſſion, and gain an Advantage againſt a Soul habitually thus Convinced, it is further neceſſary that there be a <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Conſtant Acting of that Conviction</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152948:40"/>the Soul, or otherwiſe it may be Intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Aſſiduous Importunities of his Luſts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, it is neceſſary to ſee what kind of <hi>Means</hi> it muſt be that muſt work ſuch a Conviction of ſuch weight and evidence, that may rectifie the Judgment in reference to this Conteſt with the ſenſual Appetite, and actuate ſuch a Conviction to attain its due effect. <hi>Moral Philoſophy</hi> contains in it excellent Precepts and Reaſonings to the ſubjecting of the ſenſual Appetite to the dictate of Reaſon, and to a Moral Cleanſing of the Heart: But it cannot attain its end; for though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds Inconveniences on the one ſide, and Conveniences on the other, yet they have great defects that make it Ineffectual: The things which it propoſeth are in themſelves of unequal weight to the Pleaſure and Content of ſatisfying the ſenſual Appetite, <hi>viz.</hi> On the one ſide Fame and Glory, and Reputation and Serenity of mind; on the other ſide, the Baſeneſs of Luſt in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the excellency of Reaſon, that it is a thing common to us with the Beaſt; and ſuch like: and therefore, though theſe be fine Notions, and ſuch as may be weighty with old Men, whoſe Luſts have left them, yet with young Men, they Import nothing:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152948:40"/>And therefore the Philoſopher well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for it by determining that <hi>Juvenis non eſt idoneus auditor Moralis Philoſophiae,</hi> and Conſequently it is a kind of Phyſick, that may be good for them that need it not, but of no uſe for them that want it: for the truth is, the Fame and the Infamy are not of weight equivalent to Counterpoiſe the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a Luſt in thoſe that are Inclinable to them. 2. Another great defect in the things propounded is this, that is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Humane Laws, that though they may be of ſome efficacy to prevent the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Act, when it meets with Infamy in the Action, or Reputation in the forbearing, yet it doth inevitably give a diſpenſation to Sin, if committed with Secrecy; much leſs doth it at all Cleanſe the Heart from the love of Luſt, the delight in it, the Contemplation of it. We are therefore to ſearch for a higher, <hi>or more effectual Conviction</hi> than this; and therefore, 1. We muſt ſee whether there be any thing that propounds ſome thing that may over ballance the Advantage of Luſt, or the love of it in the Heart; 2. A means of Conviction of the truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the thing ſo propounded.</p>
                  <p>For the former, it is apparent that the Sacred Scriptures, and they alone, do furniſh us with ſuch materials; prohibiting not only
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152948:41"/>the Acts of Luſt, but alſo the very Motions and Inclinations to it; the Deſires of the Heart, of it; the Love of the Heart to it; and this under pain of the diſpleaſure of God, everlaſting Death, Hell fire, <hi>on the one ſide;</hi> on the other ſide, in caſe of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this Command, the Favor of God, Everlaſting Life, and Happineſs: and in order to the diſcovering whether our Hearts walk in Sincerity, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, aſſures us that God beholds and obſerves the Motions, Deſires, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Thoughts, and Purpoſes of our Hearts, and will one day lay them open, <hi>When the ſecrets of all Hearts ſhall be Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> And theſe are things that are of ſuch a Nature as preponderates all the good, that can be in Luſt; furniſheth the Soul with ſuch Arguments againſt it, as carries thunder in them. 2. And that theſe may be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſented to by the Soul, without which they Import nothing to the end we ſpeak of, there are theſe effectual Means, which Almighty God affords us: Firſt, The word of God, which doth not only contain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and Perſwaſions for the Cleanſing of the Heart; but alſo a high evidence of the Truth and Reality and Benefit of thoſe Materials and Perſwaſions: it is a Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and a Cleanſing word: Jo. 15.3. <hi>Ye
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152948:41"/>are clean through the word, which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> Secondly, A high Congruity of the word of God, in relation to a future life of Rewards and Puniſhments, unto the very Sentiments of Reaſon and the light of Nature it ſelf; the Senſe of which life of future Rewards and Puniſhments carries with it, not only a Conviction of the great Advantage of a Clean Heart above an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Heart, but alſo a very effectual motive to the Cleanſing of the Heart, greater and more vigorous than all the Arguments of the beſt Philoſophers. Thirdly, The Powerful <hi>Spirit of God</hi> works up in the Soul an aſſent unto them; and that of ſuch a ſtrength as is no leſs Convincing than Science it ſelf, which is <hi>Faith:</hi> and therefore Faith thus wrought, purifies the Heart, as well as the life. 3. And for a Conſtant and un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Application and re-minding us of theſe Truths, God is pleaſed to aſſiſt us with the continual aſſiſting Grace of his Spirit acting in and by the Conſcience, which is in a great meaſure cleanſed, quickned, and actuated, which watcheth us and our very Thoughts, and Chides them, re-minding us of theſe great Truths, which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and thereby actuating and acting our Faith of theſe Truths, as often as the occaſion offers it ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:152948:42"/>
                  <p n="5">5. And by this means, 1. The Intellectual Power of the Soul is reſtored in a great meaſure to its primitive Dominion, or at leaſt is qualified aright in order to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Will, wherein indeed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Soul is principally ſeated, is likewiſe reſtored to its Domination and Rule.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Partly by theſe Impreſſions, which are as before received by the Underſtanding and the practical Determination thereof: for it is clearly preſented now to her, that it is the Greater Good to deny Luſt both in the Practice and Love of it, than to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; And Conſequently the Will moves towards the Greater Good, according to its proper and natural Inclination. 2. There is yet a further Effect wrought upon the Will: <hi>viz.</hi> The ſenſe of the Love of Chriſt, the end of his Death, to redeem us from theſe Luſts, whereby, even by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Gratitude, it takes up Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Obeying him. This Truth, though it be firſt received in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and entertained by Faith, yet it doth immediatly work upon the Will and Affections: <hi>viz.</hi> An Averſion to that Luſt, that Crucified her Saviour, and which the ſame Saviour, upon the Indearment of his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152948:42"/>own Blood, begs us to Crucifie. 3. There is yet a further work upon the Will by the ſecret and powerful working of the Spirit of God, ſtrengthning, and perſwading, and reſtoring it to its Liberty and Juſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over the ſenſual Appetite.</p>

                  <head>THE FOLLY, AND Miſchief of SIN.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is a moſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable and Fooliſh</hi> thing; The Content that is in it, is but Imaginary, and dyes in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a Thought; The Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is nothing but Diſappointment, and the Fruition of it periſheth in a moment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the infallible <hi>Seed of Shame and Miſchief,</hi> which, without it be intercepted by Repentance and the Mercy of God, doth as naturally, and infallibly grow from it, as <hi>Hemlock</hi> and <hi>Henbane</hi> do from their proper Seeds: and though the nature of ſome Sins is more ſpeedy, and viſible in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that Fruit; yet moſt certainly, ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later, every Sin yields his Crop even in this life. The beſt Fruit it yields is Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Repentance, which though it be good in compariſon of their Fruit enſuing, if omitted; yet certainly, it is not without
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152948:44"/>much Trouble and Diſcompoſure of Mind; and the Bitterneſs even of Repentance it ſelf infinitely over-ballanceth the Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Sin did yield.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sin doth not only produce an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Fruit, but there is alſo a certain Spight and <hi>Malignity in the Fruit</hi> it yields, carrying in it the very Picture, Reſemblance and Memorial of the Sin for the moſt part, which doggs a Man in the puniſhment of it, with the very Repetition of the Guilt, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It <hi>Poyſons and Invenomes all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> If a Man be in Proſperity, it either makes it an occaſion of new Sins to cover or ſecure them that are paſt; or it ſowers and infeſts the very State it ſelf, with ſad Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions of the Fruit due to his Sin; Or hants him in his Jollity, like as I have ſeen an Importunate Creditor, a young Gallant, which blaſts all his Comfort and Contentment. If a Man be in Adverſity, it adds Affliction to Affliction; The beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Affliction, is a clear Conſcience, but when a Man hath outward Troubles, and a Miſ-giving Guilty Soul, it makes his Affliction black and Deſperate.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It <hi>Diſcompoſeth</hi> and <hi>diſorders,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifies a Man <hi>for any Good Duty,</hi> either to God or Man: I pray, but I bring along with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152948:44"/>me a ſenſe of Sin, that makes me Ungrateful to my ſelf, and how can I expect to be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, the Pure and Holy God, who hates nothing but Sin? I beg Bleſſings, but how can I expect to receive a Bleſſing from him, whom I but lately preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly offended? If my Son or Servant hath offended me, and comes to ask a benefit of me, I look upon it as a ſawcy Preſumption, and can I expect to have better Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from my Maker, than I think fit to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my fellow Creature? The truth is, there is no Petition comes ſeaſonably from a Man under the Guilt of Sin, but Pardon, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>If I do a Good Work, the Sin, that I ſtand guilty of, makes the Comfort I take in it, or in other commendations of it, Inſipid and Empty: my Heart tells me there is a Sin in my Conſcience, that makes me aſhamed to own the Good that is in the Action.</p>
                  <p>If I ſee a fault in another, that my Place or Condition requires me to Reprove, the ſenſe of my own Guilt makes me either backward to Reprove, or Condemn my ſelf, while I am Reproving another, with ſuch thoughts as theſe: <hi>I am Reproving a Sin in another, where I ſtand as Guilty in the ſight of God as the perſon reprehended: if he knew my Sin, how juſtly might he throw my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion into my own face, and if he know
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152948:45"/>it not, yet the God of Heaven, before whom I stand and the Conſcience which I bear within me, makes my Reprehenſion of another, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of my ſelf.</hi> If I go about any action of my life, though never ſo Honeſt, Juſt and Lawful, yet my miſ-giving thoughts make me either un-active in it, or fill me with pre-apprehenſions of miſchief or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in it; how can I expect a bleſſing from God, whom I have offended, in any buſineſs I undertake? I carry along with me in all I do, the Curſe that the Lord threatned, Deut. 28.20. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend upon thee Curſing, Vexation, and Rebuke in all that thou ſetteſt thy hands unto,</hi> and verſe 29. <hi>Thou ſhalt not proſper in thy ways,</hi> and verſe 34. <hi>So that thou ſhalt be mad for the ſight of thine eyes which thou ſhalt ſee,</hi> and verſe 67. <hi>In the morning thou ſhalt ſay, Would God it were Evening; and at Evening thou ſhalt ſay, Would God it were Morning, for the fear of thine Heart wherein thou ſhalt fear, and for the ſight of thine Eyes which thou ſhalt ſee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Certainly all this grows from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conguity</hi> and Diſſonancy, that is <hi>between ſin and the true right conſtitution of the Nature of Man,</hi> that is thereby made unuſeful for his proper Operations; juſt as a ſore, or a bone out of joynt diſables the proper ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152948:45"/>of a Limb; or, as a noxious humour diſorders the Stomach, Liver, or Spleen, in its proper Office; or, as a Diſeaſe, or ill diſpoſition of the Body makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to its proper Actions; ſo doth the Sins, and Defilements, and Guilt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of it upon the Soul, diſable it in its Works and Offices; and this is the evidence of it, Every thing is then in its right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution when it is in that ſtate, that the Wiſe God of Nature ordered it; and ſo far as it declines from that poſition or ſtate, ſo far forth it looſeth its Uſefulneſs and proper Happineſs; and therefore it is conſequently evident, that every thing, that loſeth its Uſefulneſs and Happineſs, is out of that Conſtitution that God Almighty meant for it; and therefore, in as much as apparently all Sin doth introduce this Diſorder and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, it is plain that Mankind thereby is in another condition than God at firſt made him, and intended he ſhould be in.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore, It is apparent, <hi>That all Sin is againſt Nature,</hi> and a Violation and Breach even of the Law and Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which is nothing elſe but the Station, Courſe, and Frame, that God with moſt Admirable Wiſdom and Goodneſs framed for Man. Man ſtands in <hi>a double ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> 1. A Subordination <hi>within</hi> himſelf,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152948:46"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Faculties inferiour to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; And 2. A Subordination to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>without</hi> himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Will of his Creator, which though it ſeems extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, yet in truth it is eſſential and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Internal</hi> Subordination is of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour parts and faculties to the Superiour, <hi>viz.</hi> The Senſual Appetite and Paſſions to Reaſon and to Judgment. God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Body of Man, and thoſe Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are ſubſervient to it, unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Light of Judgment and Underſtanding, that he hath put into the Soul: and becauſe, as it is moſt juſt that the Soul and its Superiour Faculties ſhould be ſubordinate to the Will and Direction of God, ſo the Soul ſtands in need of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in order to the Government of his little Province committed to him; and therefore, as it happens in Government, when the People break the ſubordination to the Intermediate Magiſtrate, or the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Magiſtrates break the ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Supream, preſently there inſues Diſorder and Miſchief and Confuſion, ſo when the Body, or thoſe Faculties, that are exerciſed in order to it, as the natural Luſts and inclinations of the Body, or thoſe that reſult much from it, as the Paſſions, prevail upon the Judgment or Reaſon, either by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152948:46"/>their Violence, or want of due Vigilance and Severity in the Soul in its Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or if the Reaſon and Judgment do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or croſs the Commands of God, or make not uſe of the Divine Directions to aſſiſt and guide her in her Adminiſtration, this is Sin, and preſently brings Confuſion, and Diſorder, and Diſcompoſure in the whole man, and makes it Unſerviceable for the Ends to which it was ordained.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Breach</hi> of that Truſt committed to the Soul, <hi>conſiſts</hi> either in the <hi>want of</hi> that due <hi>Improvement</hi> of the Province commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Souls Vicegerency, according to the Advantages that it hath; (which is the Caſe of the unprofitable Servant, that did not miſ-imploy his Talent, but did not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to his Maſters Advantage;) or, which is worſe, <hi>Miſ-government and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployment</hi> of the Province committed to its Charge to the diſadvantage of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152948:48"/>over the Vicegerent or Deputy to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The great <hi>Engins of this Defection</hi> are the <hi>Corrupt Inclinations</hi> of the ſenſual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, Luſts, and Paſſions of the Body, and eſpecially thoſe, which are the great Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and moſt powerful in reſpect of their Congruity to the Natural Inclinations, and temper, or rather diſtemper of the Body; or thoſe <hi>Temptations</hi> which the World offers, eſpecially ſuch as are moſt incident to the Place, Station, Relation, or Condition, wherein we ſtand in the World. The former come under the name of the Luſt of the Fleſh, the latter under the name of the Luſts of the Eye, and Pride of Life.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thoſe Luſts and Temptations are the Inſtruments in the hand of Satan, either by Solicitation to Corrupt, or by Power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Vicegerency of the Soul under God, and to bring it over by Allurements or Force, to a Defection from him, and in both ways fight againſt the Soveraignty of God, and conſequently his Glory; and againſt the Perfection of the Soul, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently its Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thoſe <hi>Luſts are of greateſt Power,</hi> that have the greateſt dearneſs to the Body, either in reſpect of Age, Complexion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, Condition, or Station; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152948:48"/>of greateſt Danger to the Soul, and fight againſt it with greateſt Advantage: In a young Man, or a ſtrong ſanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, Luxury, Wantonneſs, and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are moſt ordinarily moſt prevalent; In an old, or Melancholy Man, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; In a middle Aged, or Cholerick Man, Anger, Ambition, Violence; In a Rich or Powerful Man, Oppreſſion, Diſdain, Pride: In a Poor Man, Diſcontent, Rapin. And there is ſcarce any Man, but hath ſome <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Luſt</hi> or Sin, that he will be content to ſell all the reſt of his Luſts for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that: tempt him to a Luſt not ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Complexion, Age or Condition, he will eaſily reject it; but if it be a Luſt ſuitable to his Age, Complexion, or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will hardly, or with difficulty enough refuſe it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. As every Luſt ſuitable to our Age; Complexion, or Condition, is of greateſt power, and conſequently of greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſo every ſuch Luſt once entertained in Practice, becomes of greater Strength, and Conſequently of greater Danger than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and this upon a double reaſon: Firſt, Becauſe the Soul is made the weaker, and more emaſculated by the reception and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of a Luſt: then <hi>it is</hi> like <hi>amiſa pudicitia,</hi> which is the likelier to make a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152948:49"/>Proſtitute: Senſe of Reputation is a great matter to keep Innocence, but a loſt Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation makes way for a further degree of Guilt. Again, the Soul, by admittance and entertainment of Luſt, gains a kind of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and dearneſs with the Luſt, and admits it with leſs difficulty a ſecond time; becauſe it is become now an acquaintance. And laſtly, every ſin cauſeth a withdrawing of Divine aſſiſtance from the Soul, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranging of the Soul from it, a kind of ſhameful abſenting of the Soul from God; and ſo as it loſeth its ſtrength, it loſeth its confidence of addreſs for it; which every Mans experience will teach him. Secondly, On the part of Luſt, it is made more bold, and confident, and adventuring, than it was before it was entertained: It was then more modeſt and baſhful, becauſe it knew not how-it ſhould be entertained; but now it grows Confident and Imperious.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. When Luſt hath gotten the Victory in the Soul, it either makes the Soul, which is Gods Vicegerent, his Vaſſal, or his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; either the Soul becomes ſervant and vaſſal to Sin, or at beſt it is led away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by it: And in both caſes, God is dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Soul imbaſed, and Luſt gets the Empire and Dominion; and the Soul hath either broken his truſt with God, or not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152948:49"/>performed it as it ſhould: The Province committed to his management loſt, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment abuſed, the Soveraign injured, and the Vicegerent is either become a Rebel, or at beſt a Priſoner, by his own default.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The <hi>Means of Prevention</hi> of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Order ſettled by the great Soveraign is. Firſt, That the Deputy <hi>take due notice of his Inſtructions;</hi> for he is not placed in that Province without his Rules of Government, which his Soveraign hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him. Secondly, That he be very <hi>Vigilant</hi> over the ſecret Confederacies, motions, and riſings of Luſt againſt thoſe Inſtructions; for Luſt is buſie, troubleſome, and active, and ſtudies and watcheth all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Defection. Thirdly, That he keep his Authority with <hi>Reſolution and Courage;</hi> for Luſt, if it be worthy the name of a Subject, it is a petulant and ſawcy, but yet a ſlaviſh baſe-minded Subject; a little countenance will make it inſolent, and a ſevere hand over it will make it ſervile; and eſpecially, that this ſeverity be held over thoſe Luſts, that have or pretend to the greateſt intereſt in the Age, Complexion, Diſpoſition, Quality, Station, or Condition of the Province; for as they have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152948:50"/>opportunities to do miſchief, ſo they will ſooneſt grow Inſolent.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Though a ſlight and gentle ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency over Luſt will teach it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet under a ſevere and rigid govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the moſt it will adventure upon, will be to ask admiſſion: and upon ſuch addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Duty of this Deputy is to be ſo far from giving admiſſion to it, that it ought not to Complement, or Treat, or hold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or Debate with it, but <hi>flatly deny</hi> it; As a ſevere Deportment of the Soul muſt keep Luſt from commanding, ſo it muſt check and diſcountenance it in asking: the holding of conference, and debate, and reaſoning with any Luſt, is but a preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to its admiſſion, and gives but the more Confidence, Boldneſs, Importunity and hope of ſucceſs to it. <hi>Eves</hi> reaſoning with the Serpent was the firſt breach of her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: Luſt muſt not be mannerly treated withall, but flatly denyed. This is that great Doctrine of <hi>Self-Denial</hi> which the New Teſtament ſo ſolemnly enjoyns: for though in truth, our Luſts are not our ſelves, yet thoſe that grow out of our natural Conſtitution or Condition, are next to our ſelves, and by miſtake we are apt to eſteem them, our Eyes, our Hands, our Selves.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:152948:50"/>
                  <p n="13">13. This kind of dealing with Luſts and Temptations will in a little time diſ-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Soul with them, and make the Soul and them ſtrangers one to another. It is eaſily ſeen, that thoſe things which a Man uſeth himſelf unto, ſo that they ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come another nature, yet ſome deſuetude from them do evidence to him,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aſperam nobis, &amp; inſuavem virtutum viam nimia facit vitiorum Conſuetudo, quae ſi in partem alteram transfera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, invenietur (ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut Scriptura dicit) Semita Juſtitiae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> S. Hier. Ep. 14.</note> that they are not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and unſeparable as he once thought them: A man that hath accuſtomed himſelf to vain Swearing, ſo that he can ſcarce ſpeak a ſentence without an Oath, and when he is told of it, profeſſeth he cannot help it, yet let him reſolvedly break the cuſtom of it, he will not find that he miſſeth that unhappy Rhetorick in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; the like is eaſily ſeen in Drinking, Gaming, Wantonneſs, and thoſe other Sins that are precious and dear to a man in his cuſtom and uſe of them; by a little reſolute diſ-uſer of them, he will ſoon find he doth not miſs them; he can eaſily ſpare them, and be without them: nay, he finds as great an inconvenience and burdenſomneſs to re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them, as before to leave them. And beſides the Reaſons before given, there is this more in it, that the Value and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:152948:51"/>that is taken in them, is by the great Expectation and Contentment that the mind ſeeks in the pre-apprehenſions &amp; Image that the mind makes to it ſelf of them: for the Contentment of the things themſelves bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, and in themſelves, is but flat and empty; but the Imagination dreſſeth them up beyond themſelves, both in their pre-apprehenſion and fruition: and ſo the Value and Contentment of them is due more to the Fancy and falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of the mind, than to the things themſelves: and therefore, if once the mind can be eſtranged from Converſing with the thought and Imagination of them, they will ſoon loſe their Eſtimate and Delight; becauſe they are ſeparated and kept aſunder from that which gilds and dreſſeth them into that delightful and amiable ſhape, which couſens and deceives men into their actings of them. Now this ſevere hand againſt them, denying their acceſs, refuſing Converſe with them, doth prevent the mind from faſhioning of Imaginations of them, and dreſſing up thoſe Imaginations of them in pleaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful repreſentations, and then in a little while they are quite laid aſide, and not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor thought of; and their own natural worth, without that ſecret brooding of the mind upon them, doth not with any ſtrength,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152948:51"/>ſolicit or ſubdue the mind to the actings of them. We are in this kind like Children, who have gotten ſome toy into their hands, that, it may be, may be hurtful, and they mightily prize them and ſet a great rate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: but let them be taken away, in a little while they will not miſs them, but be as merry and contented, as when they had them.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>The Succeſs</hi> of this Uncourteous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our Luſts and Temptations, will much countervail the unpleaſingneſs of the Duty. A man is tempted to a Sin, he holds conference with it, and is inticed to treat with it, and to think of it, and it pleaſeth him; but it is a Thouſand to one if it ſtay there; but unleſs ſome great diverſion by the Grace of God, or ſome External re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint by Shame or Puniſhment, prevent him, he commits the Sin; and ſo Luſt, when it hath Conceived, will bring forth Sin, and Sin, when finiſhed, will bring forth Shame and Death, or at the beſt Shame and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. How will a Man reckon with himſelf; <hi>What am I the better for that Contentment that I took in this Sin? the Contentment is paſt, and that which it hath left me, is nothing elſe but a miſ-giving Conſcience, a ſenſe of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed God, aſhamed to bring my mind in his preſence, a pre-apprehenſion of ſome miſchief
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152948:52"/>or inconvenience to follow me, a deſpondency of mind to draw near to God under it, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great deal of Sorrow and Vexation, or Affliction under it, or, which is the uſual grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Satan after Sin committed, to put away the remembrance of a Sin paſt, with the committing of another, till at last the Guilt grows to ſuch a</hi> moles, <hi>that a Man is deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given over to all kind of Villany; and as his Sins increaſe, his Guilt and Shame increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. On the other ſide, I have denyed my Lust, or my Temptation, and it is gone: Firſt, I am as well without it, as if I had committed it; for it may be the Sin had been paſt, and the contentment that I took in it, and I had been as well without it; but, beſides all this, I have no Guilt cleaving to my Soul, no sting in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, no diſpondent nor miſ-giving Mind, no Interruption of my Peace with God or my ſelf; I enjoy my Innocence, my Peace, my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to God with Comfort: nay, more than all this, I have a ſecret Attestation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in my Conſcience, that I have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and have pleaſed him, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Enemy of his Glory and my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I have a ſecret advance of my Intereſt and Confidence in him and Dependance upon him, and Favour with him, and Liberty and Acceſs to him, which doth Infinitely more than counter vail the ſatisfaction of an impure, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152948:52"/>unprofitable, and vexing Luſt, which leaves no footſteps behind it but ſhame, and Sorrow, and Guilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. As Reſolution and Severity to a mans ſelf is one of the beſt remedies againſt the flatttery and deceit of Luſt, ſo there are certain <hi>Expedients</hi> that are <hi>ſubſervient to that Reſolution:</hi> as namely, Firſt, <hi>Avoiding of Idleneſs;</hi> for the Soul in the Body is like a flame, that, as it were, feeds upon that oily ſubſtance of the Body, which according to the various qualifications or temper of the Body, gives it a tincture ſomewhat like it ſelf; and unleſs the Soul be kept in action it will dwell too much upon that tincture that it receives from it, and be too intent and pleaſed, or at leaſt too much tainted, and tranſported, and delighted with thoſe fuliginous foul Vapors that ariſe from the Fleſh and natural Conſtitution. Keep it therefore buſied about ſomewhat that is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it, that may divert that Intention and Complacency in thoſe fumes, that the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of the Soul is apt to take in them, and ſo be tempted, tranſported, or abuſed by them. Secondly, A frequent and conſtant <hi>Conſideration of the Preſence of God and his Holy Angels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 15.7, 10. 1 Cor. 4.9.</note> who are Spectators of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to God and his party, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152948:53"/>in it; or of thy Apoſtaſie, Bruitiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Baſeneſs of mind, and grieved at it. <hi>If a good Man were but acquainted with all my Actions, and Motions of my mind upon the Advance of Lusts and Temptations, it would make me aſhamed to offend in his ſight: but much more, if a pure and glorious Angel did in my view attend, obſerve, and behold me: but when the Eternal God doth behold me, who hath given me this Command to deny my Luſts, and hath told me the danger of yielding to them, that they bring forth Sin and Death, and Hell, offers his Grace to aſſist me, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Reward to my Obedience and Conſtancy, how ſhall I then dare to offend with ſo much preſumption? Thirdly,</hi> A <hi>frequent</hi> Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Satisfaction, Sufferings, and Interceſſion. <hi>Theſe Luſts that now ſolicit me to their obſervance, were thoſe that Crucified my Saviour; it was the end of his Paſſion to Redeem me, not only from the Guilt, but from the ſubjection to them; It is he that beholds me; how ſhall I trample his Blood under foot? If I prostitute my ſelf to them, how ſhall I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, and as much as in me lies, diſappoint him in the very end of his Incarnation? How ſhall I ſhame his Goſpel before men, and as much as in me lies, put him to ſhame in the preſence of the Father, and all the Holy Angels, when they ſhall be witneſſes of my preferring a baſe Luſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152948:53"/>before him? How can I expect the Interceſſion of my Saviour for me at the right hand of God, who beholds me thus unworthily to ſerve a Luſt, though to my Damnation, rather than obey my Redeemer to my Salvation.</hi> 4. <hi>Frequent</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Death and Judgment. <hi>A baſe Luſt ſolicites me to obey it: Shall I accept or deny it? It may be this may be the laſt action of my Life, and poſſibly Death, that might have been reſpited, if I ſhall deny my Luſt; may be my next event, if I obey it; and as Death finds me ſo will Judgment find me: Would I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that ſuch an act as this ſhould be the</hi> Amen <hi>of my Life, and it may be, ſeal me up to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rejection? Would I be content that my Soul ſhould be preſently carried into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, under the laſt act of my Life to his diſhonor? Or, on the other ſide, if I deny this baſe importunate Meſſenger of Hell, and it ſhould pleaſe God to ſtrike me preſently after with Sickneſs or Death, would it not be a more comfortable entrance into that black Valley with a clear Conſcience, and an Innocent Heart, that could with Comfort ſay, as once</hi> Hezekiah <hi>did upon the like occaſion. Iſai.</hi> 38.3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart? Fifthly, A due <hi>Conſideration of the Iſſue of thoſe ſolicitations of Lust;</hi> if aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto, the end of it is Death; it will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152948:54"/>be bitterneſs in the end; it cannot with all its pleaſures countervail that bitterneſs that will moſt certainly attend it; nor can it give any ſecurity againſt it. Suppoſe thou art ſolicited to a thought or act of Injuſtice, Impurity, or Intemperance; if thou wilt needs be talking with the Temptation, ask it; <hi>whether it be not a Sin againſt that God, in whoſe hands thy Soul is? and if it be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Anger and Diſpleaſure be not a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence of that Sin? and if it be, may not he inflict the iſſues of that wrath of his, when, and in what meaſure he pleaſeth? and if he may, what ſecurity can this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion give against it? hath it an Arm of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence to ſecure me againſt the power of him, that is Omnipotent? and if it cannot, what Compenſation or amends can it make me, to countervail the Damage of his Wrath, or the very Danger of it? Can the Pleaſure or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the Sin do it? alas! the Pleaſure will paſs away, in, it may be, a Life, a Day, a moment; but the Guilt and Torment continues to Eternity.</hi>

                     <hi>MOderation,</hi> is that Grace or Vertue whereby a Man governs his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Appetite, his Paſſions and Affections, his Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from all Exceſs and Exorbitancy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It refers,</hi> 1. To the ſenſual Appetite: 2. To the Paſſions of the Mind: 3. To Speech and Words: 4. To the Actions of our Life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Moderation in <hi>the ſenſual Appetite:</hi> and this is properly Temperance, which is a Prudent Reſtraint of our Appetite from all Exceſs in Eating, Drinking, and thoſe other inclinations that gratifie our ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>And certainly this becomes us not only as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:152948:57"/>Chriſtians, but as Reaſonable Creatures; for the ſenſual Appetite, and thoſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that tend to the gratification of our External ſenſes, are in a great meaſure the ſame in Men and in Brutes, and they are in the due order and uſe Good and Convenient for both: we cannot live without them But Almighty God hath given to Mankind a Higher and a Nobler Nature; namely, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Reaſon, which in the right poſture and conſtitution of the Humane Nature is to Govern, Guide, Moderate, and Order that inferiour Faculty, that is common to the Brutes, as well as to Man. And that Man that keeps not this Regiment and Superintendency of his Nobler Faculty, degrades himſelf into the condition of a Brute, and indeed into ſomewhat worſe; for even the Inſtincts of Brutes do for the moſt part regulate their ſenſual Appetite from Exceſs and Immoderation. But becauſe this belongs to that diſtinct vertue of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, I forbear further Inſtances herein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moderation of our <hi>Paſſions and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> and theſe are here principally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; namely, Love, Hatred, or Anger, Joy, Grief, Hope, Fear, and thoſe other mixt or derivative Paſſions, that ariſe in Man upon the preſentment of their ſeveral Objects.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>the Paſſions of the Mind</hi> conſidered ſimply in themſelves are a <hi>part of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152948:57"/>our Nature</hi> and not Evil: but when duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and ordered, are of excellent Uſe to us; yet if they once become unruly, miſ-placed, or over-acted, they occaſion the greateſt troubles in the World, both to the perſons themſelves in whom they are, and to others.
<note place="margin">Jam. 4.1.</note> We may eaſily trace almoſt all the Sins and Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and Diſtempers, and Troubles, and Diſorders, that we obſerve in our ſelves or others, to the Immoderation, and Diſorder of the Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the due Moderation of them is of great conſequence, both for the attaining of true Tranquillity of Mind, of great Regularity in all we do or ſay, and to the common Peace, Order and Benefit of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>The Moderation therefore of all our Paſſions <hi>conſiſts principally in theſe two things:</hi> 1. That they be not miſ-placed or ſet upon wrong Objects; as to Love that which we ſhould not Love, but poſſibly Hate; or to Hate that which we ſhould Love; and ſo for the reſt; 2. That being rightly placed in reſpect of their Objects, yet that they be not intended or acted beyond that degree that may be juſtly allowed to thoſe Objects: And this is properly Immoderation, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is merely Miſpriſion, Errour, Enormity, Folly.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:152948:58"/>
                  <p>And therefore when we ſpeak of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Paſſions, it is intended in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to thoſe things, about or upon which our Paſſions may be lawfully uſed or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, ſo that they be kept within their juſt bounds and meaſures.</p>
                  <p>And ſince all the Objects of our Paſſions are either ſomething that is Good or ſo thought, as the Objects of our Love, Joy, Hope, or ſomething that is Evil, or ſo eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Objects of our Hatred, or Anger, Sorrow, Fear, <hi>the true meaſure</hi> of theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or Paſſions is to be made according to the true meaſure of that Good, or that Evil that is the preſent Object of my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If the Good or Evil be Great, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a greater intention of that Paſſion, or Affection that is imployed about them; if it be but little, the meaſure of my Paſſion or Affection ought not to exceed it, if it doth, it becomes Immoderate.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, that the ſame Paſſion or Affection may be, and indeed ought to be variouſly acted or intended about Objects of the ſame Nature; yet under different degrees of Good or Evil: I may at the ſame time have different objects of my Love, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts or kinds of Good, and of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent allayes, ſome more, ſome leſs Good, and my Love may be extended to them all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152948:58"/>at the ſame time; but the degrees of my Love are diverſified according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the degrees of Good, that each Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath, all circumſtances, adjuncts and conſequences being conſidered. The like may be ſaid, touching Evils that are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of my Hatred, Anger, Sorrow, or Fear.</p>
                  <p>The Moderation therefore of Affections <hi>requires theſe things</hi> principally: 1. <hi>A Right Judgment or Eſtimate of things</hi> Good or Evil, according to their true natures or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; for without this we ſhall not only miſtake in the degrees of Good or Evil, but even in their very natures: we ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take the Leſſer Good or Evil for the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Greater for the Leſs; but we ſhall be apt to miſtake the things themſelves, and call Evil Good, and Good Evil. Now it is certain that according to the Judgment that we have touching things Good or Evil, and their Values and Degrees, accordingly are our Paſſions, and their Extents and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports meaſured out. If I Judg or Eſteem that to be truly Good, which indeed is not, I deliver over to it my Affection of Love, Joy, or Hope: and if I Judg that to be a Great and Important Good, which is but Small or Inconſiderable; yet according to the meaſure or proportion of ſuch Eſtimate, I meaſure out the degree of my Love, Joy
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152948:59"/>or Delight in ſuch Good. A Child will ſet as great a Rate, and conſequently allow as great a meaſure of his Love or Delight to a Rattle, as a Boy doth to his Top and Scourg, or as a Man doth to a Diamond, all ariſing from the variety of their Judgment, or Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the Value of the thing. And the like may be ſaid of Evils, and their ſeveral Degrees, with relation to the Paſſions of Hatred, Sorrow, or Fear: 2. The ſecond thing required to Moderation, is <hi>a Prudent ſtaied Deliberation</hi> before the Paſſion be put into motion, that ſo the Judgment be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, touching the nature of the Object; firſt, whether it be Good or Evil; and then what Degree of Good or Evil it hath: for be the judgment never ſo Good, yet if Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion run before it, and be precipitate upon the firſt and ſudden apprehenſion of the thing propoſed, or objected, and ſo antivert the uſe of Deliberation, and the ripening of the Judgment, there muſt neceſſarily, or at leaſt ordinarily follow either Miſtake or Diſorder, or Immoderation in the Paſſion of what kind ſoever; and then the Mind is diſturbed, and put into diſorder ſuddenly, 'tis difficult then to make a right Judgment, or at leaſt, it comes too late, and many times after the miſchief is done by the haſty and precipitate Paſſion, either without or at
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152948:59"/>leaſt within the Mind; thus tranſported with Paſſion of any kind.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the <hi>General Rule</hi> for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all kind of Paſſions, is, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to preſcribe to a Mans ſelf this Law: That before he any way gives leave to his Paſſion, he will pauſe and conſider a while, touching the Object preſented, what it is, whether Good or Evil, and if either, then what Degree or Value it bears. And when once a Man hath thus peremptorily reſolved to give himſelf this Law, and hath a little while inured himſelf to the practice of it, he will find it eaſie and familiar.</p>
                  <p>This will better appear in the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>ſeveral Affections</hi> or Paſſions of the mind, principally in theſe of Love and Hatred, or Anger, Joy and Sorrow, Hope and Fear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Affection of Love,</hi> is the Principal and Governing Affection of the Mind, and the Root of all other Paſſions: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I love, renders that hateful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, which either prevents me from it, or deprives me of it, and ſo occaſions the Paſſion of Hatred or Anger: whatſoever I love, makes me joyful, or delighted in the Enjoyment of it, or Sorrowful in the loſs or deprivation of it, and ſo produceth Joy and Sorrow: whatſoever I love, I hope for, if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152948:60"/>abſent, or I fear the loſs or deprivation of it, and ſo produceth Hope and Fear.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Object</hi> of this Affection is ſomething that is Good, or ſo apprehended: The greater that Good is, the greater is the Love of it: Therefore the chiefeſt Good drawes out the chiefeſt Love; and an Infinite Good an Unmeaſurable and Boundleſs Love: and ſince <hi>Almighty God</hi> is the chiefeſt and an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Good, there cannot be any Immodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Exceſs of Love to him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Moderation of our Affection of Love, hath no place in relation to my Love of God; for I cannot love him too much. But this Moderation of this Affection prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpects <hi>the good things of this World;</hi> as Wealth, Honour, Power, Reputation, Relations, Friends, Health of Body, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and External Contentments, Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Good Cloaths, Equipage, and State, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Theſe good things of this life, have in themſelves a juſt meaſure of Good; and therefore according to that meaſure of Good that is in them, they deſerve a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable meaſure of our Love; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſings are really Bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>And among the ſeveral good things of this World, there are ſeveral <hi>Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of Good; ſome are Good, ſome are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152948:60"/>Better; and accordingly the proportion or meaſure of love, that I lend to them, is to be moderated and diſtributed and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, according to theſe different Degrees and Ranks of Good that we find in them, or the relation they bear to me; for inſtance, I may love my Wealth, but ſince Wealth is but a uſeful Inſtrument directed to other ends, as to ſupport my Life, my Health, my Relations, I am to love it leſs than theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are more valuable, and my Wealth is only Deſirable or Good to theſe Ends, and ſubordinate to theſe Uſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moderation</hi> of the Affection <hi>of Love</hi> in relation <hi>to Externals,</hi> conſiſts therefore prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in theſe things;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we have <hi>a juſt Eſtimate</hi> of the Good that is in the things we ſet our Love upon, and that we do not over-value them, or Expect that Good to be in them, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is not, we muſt look upon them as they are; it may be they are ſuch as have not a perfect ſincere Good in them, but mixture of Evil, or ſuch as have not a ſtable or perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Good in them, but are mutable or mortal; or ſuch as have a Good in them, proportionate only to our preſent condition, and when our condition is altered, the Good that is in them vaniſheth: And if they be ſuch, we muſt eſteem them as ſuch, and love
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152948:61"/>them as ſuch; and ſuch for the moſt part are all Worldly things, Health, Wealth, Friends, Relations, nay our very Lives.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we look upon all the Good that is in the World, as <hi>derived from the Goodneſs of God,</hi> and infinitely below that Good that is in him: and therefore all our Love to them muſt be ſubordinate to that Love that we owe to God, and muſt be controlled by it, and in all competitions muſt give place unto it. Suppoſe I have great Wealth, or many Relations, I may, nay in reaſon I ought to bear ſome Love to them; but I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is but a derivative and a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Good, and therefore I muſt Love them with this reſerve and qualification, that if God pleaſe to call for them, I muſt quietly part with them; for as I have them under that condition, ſo the Love I owe to God, the ſupreme Good, engageth me to ſubmit to his Will, and to obey it; for if I Love him beſt, I muſt be pleaſed with what his Will is pleaſed, for I judg him the beſt Good, and therefore his Will the beſt Will; and the Good Pleaſure of his Will muſt be the rule of my ſubjection, otherwiſe his Love hath not the preheminence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we make aright <hi>a due Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between Good things of ſeveral kinds,</hi> and give that the preference in our Love, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152948:61"/>upon a due Judgment ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and this concerns and principally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf in the Competition of ſeveral good things, and of our Affections to them. The Merchant loves his Goods well, but in a Storm to ſave his Life, is content to throw his Goods over-board. And the exerciſe of Wiſdom in this kind, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conſiſts in the due weighing the ſeveral values of Good things of ſeveral natures, and ranging of them in their ſeveral Ranks; and alſo in the diligent conſideration of the ſeveral Circumſtances, that accompany ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, for many times ſome good things that are in themſelves preferrable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, receive an abatement and allay by circumſtances, and others leſs preferrable receive an advance by the circumſtances that attend them. 1. Therefore touching the <hi>Different Ranks</hi> of things themſelves, in matters of my own private concernment, I am to prefer my Soul and the Good thereof, before all my External advantages, <hi>for what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul;</hi> I am to prefer the Good of my Health, before the Good of my Wealth. Again, in things relating to my ſelf and others; I am to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſafety of the State wherein I live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Wealth, yea, and before my own ſafety, becauſe I am ſure when the whole is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152948:62"/>in danger, I muſt needs be in danger, and many more; I am to prefer a Great Good that may accrue to many, before a Smaller Good; nay, poſſibly an Equal Good that may accrue to my ſelf; nay, I am to prefer an apparent greater good to any perſon, than a ſmall and inconſiderable good to my ſelf. But above all I am to prefer the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of God, before my own Honour, Reputation, Eſtate, Contentment, or Life it ſelf; Becauſe he is the Greateſt Good, and moſt to be Loved, and the Love to his Honour is but the reſult of my Love to him. Again in things relating to others; I am to prefer a Greater Good, that may accrue to one, before a ſmaller Good to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The good of one Neighbours Soul before the good of anothers Eſtate, where, the one, but not both are juſtly in my power; I may prefer an Equal Good to a Relation, before an Equal Good to a Stranger, where the concernment or condition of both are equal, becauſe I have juſt reaſon to love a Relation before a Stranger. Again, 2. As there are different Ranks of Good, ſo <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Circumſtances</hi> make one Good preferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before another; If I ſee two Men in danger, and I can relieve but one of them, both being equal to me, I am to prefer the relief of him whoſe danger is greater, or
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152948:62"/>more imminent, before the relief of him whoſe danger is leſs or more remote; and herein Prudence and Integrity of Heart muſt be the director of my Love, and of the Emanations of it, always provided that nothing unjuſt or diſhoneſt, be mingled with what I do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That as among Goods of different Sizes or Degrees I am to prefer the Beſt, ſo among Good things, that at leaſt ſeem equal, I do prefer <hi>the moſt Laſting and Durable;</hi> for Laſtingneſs and Durableneſs is a ſpecial part of the Goodneſs of any thing; nay, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Good, that in its preſent degree or extent is greater; yet if it be leſs Durable, is not ſo Valuable as a leſs, but more laſting Good; as the greater Wealth, that muſt be ſpent in a year, is truly leſs Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than a ſmaller portion that laſts two years.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we <hi>obſerve that General Rule</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given; namely, That we never give our Affection of Love leave to run out alone without Judgment, and Conſideration, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before it, and going along with it: That we ſuffer not our Paſſions to deal out their own meaſure, but our Judgment &amp; Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: That we always keep this Affection eſpecially under Diſcipline, &amp; Government, and ſuffer it not to run away from us, as an
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152948:63"/>unruly Beaſt without a Chain; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the due Government of this Affection governs all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>And now if we look abroad into the World, or indeed but ſtrictly and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve our ſelves, we ſhall eaſily obſerve a marvellous want of Moderation of this Affection. For, not to mention the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of this Affection, upon what we ſhould really hate, we may ſee a great Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, in the Meaſure and Order of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting this Affection about things, that we may in their meaſure and kind love: we talk indeed of loving of God above all, and of the great value we ſet upon our Souls and Everlaſting life, and of Self-Denial, and againſt loving of the World, and how vain and contemptible a thing the World is: But for the moſt part they are but Words and Speculations; when we come to Practice and Life, there appears nothing, or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that anſwers theſe Notions, and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; little of that Moderation that thoſe Notions import. We love the World, the Wealth, the Honour, the Pleaſures, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of it, with all our Souls; we make it our principal buſineſs to attain and enjoy it; we account it our greateſt Calamity when we are croſſed or diſappointed in it. One Man ſets his whole heart upon his Greatneſs,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152948:63"/>another upon his Wealth, another upon his Pleaſures and Recreations, another upon his Preferment, another upon the Favour of Great Men, another upon Applauſe of his Learning or Eloquence, another upon the Beauty of a Miſtreſs or Servant: nay, ſo Childiſh we many times are, that we are ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured on very Toyes, as fine Cloaths, handſome Furniture, a fine Houſe, ſplendid Entertainments, a fine Head of Hair, or Mad Antick Poſtures, or Complements, Affected Words, Geſtures or Phraſes, Apiſh Imitations, Plays, and Gaming, new Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that many there are, that make ſuch Feathers as theſe, the Principal Objects of their Love, the Buſineſs and Study of their Lives, and are as much concerned in their diſappointment herein, as if they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Theſe are prepoſterous, and want Moderation in their Affection, becauſe they have no true Judgment or Eſtimate of things, according to their true Values.</p>

                  <head>THE VANITY AND VEXATION THAT Ariſeth from Worldly Hope and Expectation.</head>
                  <p>IT is very evident to every Mans experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>Hope and Expectation of Good,</hi> is the great Wheel, or rather Weight that moves Man to all Actions and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. The Plough-man ploughs in Hope, and the Merchant-Adventures in Hope; and the Scholar Studies in Hope; and the Soldier Fights in Hope; and ſo for all Humane Actions. And thus it muſt needs be, for in Hope or Expectation there are theſe <hi>Ingredients.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:152948:65"/>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Some End</hi> that a Man hath in proſpect, which carries a Complacency and Suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the mind; as to be Rich, or Powerful, or Learned, or Applauded. Theſe are the ordinary ends of ordinary Men; but there are ends of a nobler Condition, as to be everlaſtingly happy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of theſe nobler and higher Ends, I do not now ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That end is alſo repreſented as an End <hi>Poſſible</hi> and <hi>Attainable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there be alſo a <hi>Means</hi> propoſed <hi>probably</hi> conducing to the attaining of that End; and the Hope or Expectation of that End, is the Spirit or Life that puts a Man upon the uſe and exerciſe of that Means, thus conducible to it: For the moſt part the Complacency that is taken in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Means to the attaining of the End propoſed, is at all times equal, and moſt times exceeds the Complacency, that is taken in the injoyment of the End when attained; for the reaſon hereafter given: For the End is preſent in Expectation in the moſt ample and Comprehenſive Image or Idea thereof that can be: And this is that which quickens and drives on Action with intenſiveneſs proportionable to that meaſure of Worth and Value, that the Soul puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the End thus proſpected. And therefore he that hath a great and high Expectation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152948:65"/>and Value of the End propounded, acts with Vigor and Induſtry; he that ſets but a low Price or Valuation upon the End, as a buſineſs but little preponderating the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Induſtry to attain it, is cold in his Proſecution of it: But if the Labor and Induſtry, that is required in the uſe of that means, appear to equal the Good that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the End, the whole action is for the moſt deſerted; as he that ſets a great Value upon Wealth or Honor, ſpares no pains to attain it: So he that ſets but a low value upon it, is flat and lazy in his proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and he that looks upon it as not countervailing the pains in acquiring it, ſits ſtill and is idle in it.</p>
                  <p>For the moſt part the Good Things of this World, are preſented to Men in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, not only in their beſt dreſs, but in an Elevated Value above what is in truth in them; and this is therefore ſo upon a double <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Wiſe Providence of God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and that for this excellent End, to keep Men in Action and in Motion; which is of ſingular uſe for Mankind: For if the things exciting the ordinary Actions of Life did appear with no greater an Elevation than poſſibly they do really and intrinſically bear, the moſt part of Mankind would ſit
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152948:66"/>ſtill and do nothing. This very fallacy, that Men put upon themſelves in over expecting, is a Spur to Action and Motion; which in moſt Men would be wholly intermitted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the very Worldly concerns did ſet them in Action, as the end ſtands thus repreſented to their Expectation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mankind being indued with a Fancy or Imagination, that hath not only a power of ſeparating the Good of every thing from the Evil that may poſſibly accompany what it expects, but alſo of ſtuffing and filling the Good with great Imaginary Advances, it doth (to pleaſe and gratifie it ſelf) exerciſe both theſe Delightful Deceits. If it finds any good in what it expects, it doth upon choice thruſt away and remove all that Evil that is really annexed to it; that ſo it may not be vexed with the pre-apprehenſions of it; and it multiplies, and augments, and advanceth and magnifieth that Good that it hath left, that ſo he may with the greater delight expect what he, by this phantaſie, hath wrought himſelf up to a belief that he ſhall injoy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The miſery and unhappineſs that falls upon Mankind, from this advance of the Hope and Expectation of Worldly Ends,</hi> is obſervable in one of theſe Events thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:152948:66"/>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be there is an <hi>utter Fruſtration</hi> of the whole thing deſigned and aimed at, and ſo his Expectation is like the dream of the Hungry Man in the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 29.8.</note> that dreamed he had Eaten, and he wakes and behold he is hungry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If he attain the End he expected, be it Wealth, or Honor, or Pleaſure, or the like, yet <hi>many times there doth attend it ſome ſignal Miſchief or Evil,</hi> that he had not before the patience to think of, that doth render the whole injoyment to be utterly a thing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, and worſe than a diſappointment. And indeed the things of the World are generally of ſuch a Conſiſtency, that a very little evil joyned to it, will ſowr and make it unſavory. A want of a little ſpot of Ground for a Garden, will make the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Kingdom but inſipid to <hi>Ahab;</hi> and a want of a <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Knee, will diſreliſh all the Honor of the great Courtier <hi>Haman.</hi> The truth is, the Mind is that which makes any thing uneaſie; and it falls out, that a ſmall croſs or trouble to a Mind, eſpecially filled with expectation of a full and intire Happineſs, will be as troubleſome as a ſmall Thorn in a great Mans Foot.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet further, ſuppoſe we that the thing projected, is attained without any mixture of miſchief attending it; yet here
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152948:67"/>is an inſeparable unhappineſs that doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the moſt perfect injoyment of the beſt Worldly advantage projected and expected; it is always <hi>leſs than it was expected.</hi> The Expectation flattered it ſelf with much more than what it finds; and a Man doth infallibly find that his Mind and Phantaſie had dreſſed up and adorned the Image and Phantaſm of what was projected, much finer and goodlier than he finds it when he attains it. A Man projecting Happineſs in Honor, Wealth, Friends, Applauſe, Pleaſure, or any other Earthly thing, is much like a Builder, that hath much more content in his contrivance and expectation of the Beauty, Comlineſs, Uſefulneſs, Contentment, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of his Building, than when it is finiſhed; and when he hath done all, nay, though exquiſitly ſuitable to his Mind, yet his Contentment vaniſheth in the fruition; and the Contentment as it falls ſhort of the Expectation, ſo for the moſt part it dies and vaniſheth with the injoyment.</p>
                  <p>Take therefore this Counſel: Firſt, In all thy Deſigns of Temporal Advantages, <hi>keep thy Expectations and Hopes low,</hi> clog them with Suſpicions, and Abatements, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays; otherwiſe thy Expectations will cheat thee; and not only ſo, but render that good that thou ſhalt attain (even upon honeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152948:67"/>inſipid and flat, becauſe leſs than what thou expecteſt; whereas a low Expectation gives a reliſh to a low injoyment. Secondly, <hi>Set not thy heart upon an earneſt proſecution of Temporal Advantages:</hi> For, if they do not vex thee by Diſappointment, or ſome Thorn or Gall that doth adhere to them, yet it is Ten to One they will cheat thee, appear more glorious at a diſtance and in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than nearer hand, and in Fruition. They are trimmed up with Report and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; but in reality, and in themſelves are like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Beautiful to the Eye, but vaniſh into duſt when touched. <hi>Solomon,</hi> was certainly the Wiſeſt and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Happieſt King that ever the World knew: He had the greateſt opportunity that ever any Man had, to take a full Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the World in its choiceſt Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by reaſon of his Wealth, and Peace, and Power, and Intereſt, almoſt with all the Princes and Potentates that then Reigned.

                  <p>I Have in <hi>my courſe of life,</hi> had as <hi>many Stations</hi> and places of Habitation as moſt Men. I have been in almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Motion; and although of all Earthly things I have the moſt deſired Reſt, Retiredneſs, and a Fixed Private Station, yet the various changes that I have ſeen and found, the Publick Imployments, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my ſeeking, and againſt my Inclination have been put upon me, and many other Interventions, as well Private as Publick, have made the former part of this Text true to me in the Letter, that I have had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing City, or place of Habitation. When I had deſigned unto my ſelf a ſetled Manſion in one place, and had fitted it to my conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and repoſe, I have been preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by my neceſſary imployments to leave it and repair to another: And when again I had thoughts to find repoſe there, and had again fitted it to my convenience;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152948:70"/>yet ſome other neceſſary occurrences have diverted me from it; and thus by ſeveral viciſſitudes my dwellings have been like ſo many Inns to a Traveller, though of ſome longer continuance, yet almoſt of equal inſtability and viciſſitudes. This unſettled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Station, though troubleſome, yet hath given me a good and <hi>practical Moral;</hi> namely, that I muſt not expect <hi>my Reſt</hi> in this lower World, but muſt make it as the place of my Journey and Pilgrimage, not of my Repoſe and Reſt, but muſt look further for that Happineſs. And truly when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it hath been the Wiſdom of God Almighty to exerciſe thoſe Worthies, which he left as Patterns to the reſt of Mankind, with this kind of Diſcipline in this World, I have reaſon not to complain of it, as a Difficulty, or an Inconvenience, but to be thankful to him for it as an Inſtruction and Document, to put me in remembrance of a better Home, and to incite me to make a due proviſion for it; even that Everlaſting Reſt which he hath provided for them that love him; and by pouring me thus from Veſſel to Veſſel, to keep me from fixing my ſelf too much upon this World below. But the truth is, did we conſider <hi>this World</hi> as becomes us, even as Wiſe Men, we may eaſily find, without the help of any ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152948:70"/>Diſcipline of this Nature, that this World below, neither was intended, nor indeed can be a place of Reſt, but only a kind of Laboratory to fit and prepare the Souls of the Children of Men for a better and more abiding State, a School to exerciſe and train us up into habits of Patience and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till we are fitted to another Station, a little narrow Nurſery, wherein we may be dreſſed and pruned, till tranſplanted into a better Paradiſe. The continual Troubles and Diſcompoſures, and Sickneſſes, and Weakneſſes, and Calamities that attend our lives, the ſhortneſs and continued Vexations occurring in them; and finally, the common examples of Death and Mortality of all Ages, Sexes, Conditions of Mankind, are a ſufficient inſtruction to convince reaſonable Men, that have the Seriouſneſs and Patience to conſider and obſerve, That we have no abiding City here. And on the other ſide, if we will give our ſelves but the leaſure to conſider the Great Wiſdom of Almighty God, that orders every thing in the World to ends ſuitable and proportionable; the excellence of the Soul and Mind of Man; the great Advances and Improvements his Nature is capable of; the admirable means, the Merciful and Wiſe God hath afforded unto Mankind, by his Works of Nature
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152948:71"/>and Providence, by his Word and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to inable him for a Nobler Life, than this World below can yield, will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that there is another State, another City to come, which becomes every Good, and Wiſe, and Conſiderate Man to look after and fit himſelf for. And yet let a Man look upon the generality of Mankind with a due and ſevere conſideration, they will appear to be like a company of mad or diſtempered People. The generality of the World make it their whole buſineſs to provide for a Reſt and Happineſs in this World, to make theſe vain acqueſts of Wealth and Honor, and Preferments, and Pleaſures of this World their great, if not only Buſineſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, which is yet a higher degree of frenſie, to eſteem this the only Wiſdom, and to eſteem the careful Proviſion for Eternity, the Folly of a few weak, melancholy, fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men: Whereas it is in truth, and in due time it will moſt evidently appear, that thoſe Men that are moſt ſedulous and ſolicitous touching the attaining of their Everlaſting Reſt, are the only true Wiſe Men, and ſo ſhall be acknowledged by thoſe that now deſpiſe them. <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 5.4. <hi>We Fools accounted his life Madneſs, and his end to be without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.

                  <p>When I come to <hi>my Inn</hi> I have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration preſently occurs to me. If my Lodging be good and fair, the Furniture ſplendid, the Attendance great, the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons good and well ordered; yet I ſtreight conſider this is not the place of my Reſt, I muſt leave it to morrow, and therefore I ſet not my Heart upon it. And again, if my Inn be but poor, my Entertainment mean, my Lodging decayed, I do not preſently ſend for Painters, Carpenters, and Maſons to Repair, or Beautifie it; but I content my ſelf with it, and will bear with the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, becauſe I conſider it will be but for a night, and to morrow I ſhall be gone, and poſſibly come to my home, where I ſhall be better convenienced. And although the truth is, that this World is little other than our Inn to entertain us in our Journey to another Life; and our ſtay in it is many times very ſhort, yea, our longeſt ſtay here in compariſon of Eternity, is infinitely more ſhort than a nights lodging at an Inn in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to the longeſt life here; yet it is a wonderful thing to obſerve how much we are taken up with the concerns of this our Inn, what a ſtir we keep about it? what pains and coſt we imploy in it? how much of our time is laid out upon it? as if it were our only home. If our Lot caſt us upon a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152948:72"/>handſome Lodging (as it were) and in it furniſhed with Wealth, or Glory, or Honor, How we pride our ſelves in it? how goodly we look upon our ſelves? how happy we think our ſelves? what care we have to make it more Rich, Glorious, and Splendid: And on the other ſide, if our Lot caſt us upon a lower, meaner Station; if we are Poor, or Sickly, or Neglected, or under Hatches, what a deal of Impatience, and Diſcontent, and Unquietneſs appears? Nay, though our Lodging and Entertainment in this Inn of the World be pretty well, and will ſerve till we take our Journey; yet if it be not ſo Fine, and Splendid, and Rich, and Comely as anothers; if our Meat be enough to ſuffice nature, if our Cloaths enough to protect us from cold, if our Houſe good enough to keep off the Storms, and defend us from Injuries, yet if theſe be not ſo good as ſuch a Mans, or ſuch a Neighbors, not ſo good as my Anceſtors or Relations, Lord! What a deal of Unquietneſs, and Complaining, and Envy, and Impatience, and Turbulency of mind there is in Men? What Deſigns, and Frauds, and Plots, and Underminings, and Undue Means Men take to advance their own condition, and to depreſs others? and all this while never conſider that which would eaſily cure the extravagance, as well
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152948:72"/>of one hand, as of the other: Namely, <hi>This is not my home, it is but my Inn; if it be Beautiful, Splendid, Convenient; if my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in it be Wealthy, Honorable, Proſperous, I will not ſet my heart upon it, nor think any better of my ſelf for it, nor ſet up my Reſt in it: It is but my Inn, I muſt leave it, it may be to morrow. On the other ſide, if it be but Poor, Weak. Infirm, Ignoble, Low, I will content my ſelf, it is but my Inn, it may ſerve for my paſſage, I ſhall, it may be, leave it to morrow, and then if I have taken that due care that becomes me in my proviſion for my Eternal State, I am certain the caſe will be mended with me; however my Inn be Poor, Mean, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, Troubleſome, it is but for a night, my home will be better; I have learned, that I have here no abiding City, but I ſeek one to come.</hi> The benefits of the conſideration of this Text are many.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will teach a Man a very <hi>low eſteem of this preſent World,</hi> and never to ſet the heart upon it. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thy heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is not?</hi> It is not an abiding City: Either like the old feigned inchanted Caſtles, it will vaniſh and come to little, while we think we have faſt hold of it; or elſe we muſt leave it, we know not how ſoon: It is full of trouble and vexation when we injoy it; and very unſtable and uncertain
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152948:73"/>is our ſtay in it. 2. But let it be as good as it will, or can be, yet this Text tells of a City that is better worth our thoughts, an abiding City, a City that cannot be ſhaken, where there are no Troubles, no Thorns, no Cares, no Fears, but Righteouſneſs and Everlaſting Peace and Reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſequently it will teach us <hi>to ſeek that which is moſt of value firſt and moſt,</hi> and make that our greateſt Endeavor, which is our greateſt Concernment; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſeek that City that is to come, Peace with God in Chriſt Jeſus, and the Hope of Eternal Life. It is true, while we are in this City that continues not (this Inferior World) God Almighty requires a due care for Externals, and Induſtry in our Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Diligence in our Callings: It is part of that ſervice we ow to God, to our Families, to our Relations, to our Selves; and being done in Contemplation of his Command, it is an act of Obedience and Religious Duty to him: But this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will add this Benefit even to our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Imployments in our Calling, it will be ſure to bring a Bleſſing upon it. <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> It ſhall be given in, as an advantage and over-meaſure. 2. It will add great Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152948:73"/>to the Imployments of your Calling, and to thoſe Worldly Imployments that are requiſite for your ſupport and ſubſiſtence, when you ſhall reſign up your endeavors therein to the Good Pleaſure of Almighty God. 3. It will remove all Vexatious Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citouſneſs and Anxiety from you, when you ſhall have ſuch Conſiderations as theſe. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God (it is true) hath placed me in this World, as in a paſſage to another, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of me an Honeſt Imployment for my ſupport and ſubſiſtence; or elſe hath lent me a reaſonable liberal portion, whereby I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſubſiſt without much pains or labor; I will uſe it Soberly, Chearfully, Thankfully: If he bleſs me with Increaſe or greater Plenty, I will increaſe my Humility, Sobriety, and Thankfulneſs; but if it be not his pleaſure to bleſs me with Plenty and Increaſe, his Will be done, I have enough in that I have, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other more abiding City, wherein I ſhall have ſupplies without Want, or Fears, or Cares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Conſideration will give abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Quietneſs, Patience, <hi>Tranquillity of Mind in all conditions.</hi> Am I in this World Poor, or Deſpiſed, or Diſgraced, or in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Pain; yet this Text gives me two great Supports under it. 1. It will be but ſhort, this lower World, the Region of theſe Troubles and Storms, is no continuing,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152948:74"/>no abiding City, and conſequently the Troubles and Storms of this inferior City are not abiding or long. 2. After this flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, periſhing City, that thus paſſeth away, this ſower life which is but the Region of Death, there ſucceeds another City that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever, a City not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens, a State of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Bleſſedneſs, where are neither Cares, nor Tears, nor Fears, nor Poverty, nor Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor Want, nor Reproach: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all Patience, Chearfulneſs, and Contentedneſs bear whatſoever God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to exerciſe me withal in this life; for I well know that my light Afflictions, which are but for a moment, ſhall be attended with a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations will ſeem but dry and empty, to Men that do not deeply and conſiderately weigh matters: Ordinarily young heads think them, at leaſt, unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for their youth; but they muſt know that Sickneſs and Death will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the youngeſt in time, and that will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive People, and render the beſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of this World, either Bitter, or at leaſt Inſipid, and without any pleaſant reliſh; and then the Hopes and Expectations of this City to come, will be more of value to us
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152948:74"/>than the beſt Conveniencies and Delights this lower World can afford. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our health make it our buſineſs to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Intereſt in it, and it will be our Comfort and Benefit both in Life and Death.</p>

                  <p>COntentedneſs and Patience differ in this; that the Object of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is any condition, whether it be Good, Bad, or Indifferent; the Object of the latter is any preſent or incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Evil. But though they differ in the Latitude or Extent of their Object, yet they both ariſe from the ſame <hi>Principle,</hi> which, if rightly qualified, gives both.</p>
                  <p>The Meaſure and Original of all Paſſions is <hi>Love;</hi> and the Object of Love, is, That which is really or apparently Good. If our Love be right, it regulates all our Paſſions: For Diſcontent or Impatience ariſeth from the abſence of ſomewhat that we love and value, and according to the meaſure of our love to the thing we want, ſuch is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Diſcontent or Impatience under the want of it.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:152948:76"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that ſets his love upon that, which the more he loves, the more he injoys, is ſure to avoid the danger of Diſcontent or Impatience;</hi> becauſe he cannot want that which he loves: and though he love ſomething elſe, that may be loſt, yet under that loſs he is not obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to much Impatience or Diſcontent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſure to retain that which he moſt values and affects, which will anſwer and ſupply leſſer wants with a great advantage: The greateſt bent and portion of his love is laid out in what he is ſure to injoy, and it is but a ſmall portion of love that is left for the thing he is deprived of, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his diſcontent but little, and cured with the fruition of a more valuable Good.</p>
                  <p>He that ſets his love upon the Creature, or any reſult from it, as Honor, Wealth, Reputation, Power, Wife, Children, Friends, cannot poſſibly avoid Diſcontent or Impatience; for they are mutable, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, unſatisfactory Goods, ſubject to Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties; and according to the meaſure of his love to them, is the meaſure of his Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Impatience in the loſs of them, or diſappointment in them.</p>
                  <p>He that ſets his love upon God, the more he loves him, the more he injoys of him, and the ſurer hold he hath of him. In other
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152948:76"/>things the greateſt danger of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſequently of impatience, is when he loves them beſt; but the more love we bear to God, the more love he returns to us, and Communicates his Goodneſs the more freely to us. Therefore we are certain that we cannot be diſappointed, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have any ground of impatience or diſcontent in that which is our <hi>unum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the thing we chiefly value.</p>
                  <p>He that ſets his intireſt love on God, yet hath a liberty to iſſue a ſubordinate portion of love to other good things; as Health, Peace, Opportunities to do Good, Wife, Children, Friends: And in theſe he may be croſſed and diſappointed. <hi>But the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant love of God delivers the Soul from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and Impatience,</hi> even under theſe loſſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Soul is ſtill aſſured of what it moſt values, the love of God returned to the Soul, which compenſates and drowns the other loſs, and the diſcontent that may ariſe upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Heart is ſatisfied, that theſe loſſes come from the hand of him, whom he loves, of whoſe Truth, Wiſdom, Love, and Goodneſs he hath aſſurance, and therefore will be delivered out in meaſure, upon moſt juſt Grounds, and for moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:152948:77"/>ends. He ſends an Inſtruction along with his Rod; and the Soul reads love as well in the Rod of God, as his Staff.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Love of God, taking up the principal bent and ſtrength of the Soul, leaves but a gentle and moderate Affection to the things it loſeth, and conſequently a gentle and eaſie parting with them, or being without them. The great tumult and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order that is made in the mind upon Loſſes, Croſſes, or Diſcontents, is not ſo much from the Intrinſical Value of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but from the Eſtimation that is put upon them; were the love to them no more than they deſerve, the Diſcontent and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience in the loſs would be very little. Our chiefeſt love, when it is placed upon God, it is placed where it ſhould be; and the mind is then in its right frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and diſpenſeth his love to other things regularly, and orderly, and proportionably to their worth; and thereby the Diſcontent or Trouble, that ariſeth upon their Loſs or Diſappointment is weighed out according to their true value, agreeable to the juſt meaſure of Reaſon and Prudence: But when our love is out of his place, it becomes Immoderate and Diſorderly; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Diſcontents that ariſe upon Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments in the things we immoderately
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:152948:77"/>love, become Immoderate, Exorbitant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, Impatience, and Perturbation of Mind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our love to God brings us to a free Reſignation of our will to His: For we therefore love him, becauſe we conclude him moſt Wiſe, moſt Bountiful, moſt Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, moſt Juſt, moſt Perfect; and therefore muſt of neceſſity conclude, that his Will is the beſt Will, and fit to be the meaſure and rule of ours, and not ours of his: And in as much as we conclude that no Loſs or Croſs befals us without his Will, we do likewiſe conclude that it is moſt fit to be born: And becauſe he never Wills any thing, but upon moſt Wiſe and Juſt Reaſons, we conclude that ſurely there are ſuch Reaſons in this Diſpenſation; and we ſtudy, and ſearch, and try whether we can ſpell out thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152948:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>of that Diſtemper in reſpect of my ſelf:</hi> It puts me into a Perturbation, and makes me unuſeful for my ſelf or others, while the diſtemper is upon me: It breaks and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth my thoughts, and makes me unfit for buſineſs: It diſorders my Conſtitution of Body till the ſtorm be over: It diſcovers to others my Impotency of Mind, and is more perceived and obſerved by others, than it can be by my ſelf: It gratifies my Adverſary, when by my Paſſion I improve his Injury beyond the value of it, and injure and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and damnifie my ſelf more by my own Perturbation, than he can by the injury he doth: It evidenceth a Prevalence of my more inferior and ſenſual part, common to me with the Beaſts, above my Reaſonable and more Noble part. Sometimes indeed a Perſonated Anger, managed with Judgment, is of ſingular uſe, eſpecially in perſons in Authority; but ſuch an Anger is but a paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fire, and without perturbation: But a Paſſionate Anger upon Injuries received, or upon ſudden Conceptions of them, is always without any end at all of Good, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or effected: Nay, It is an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the attaining of any Good end; becauſe it blinds the Judgment, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Men into inconſiderate Geſtures, Words, and Actions.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:152948:79"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſideration <hi>in reſpect of others,</hi> even of the very perſons provoking. It may be they are Inſtruments, permitted by God as his Inſtruments, either to correct, or try me. Peradventure God hath bidden <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe <hi>David;</hi> be not too violent againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, leſt peradventure thou oppoſe therein the principal Agent. Again, many Men are of ſuch a pitiful conſtitution, that their injuries ariſe from very Impotence of Mind in them: Shall I be angry with them, becauſe they want that underſtanding they ſhould have? And yet it is very ſtrange to ſee the weakneſs and folly of our nature in this Paſſion, that it will break into a Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation even with Children, Drunken Men, Mad-men, Beaſts; yea, very dumb things: Witneſs our anger with the Cards and Dice, when their chances pleaſe us not; which ſhews the Unreaſonableneſs and Frenzy of this Paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There be ſome <hi>Expedients</hi> againſt it, even when the occaſion is offered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Carry always a Jealouſie over thy Paſſion, and a ſtrict Watch upon it. Take up this peremptory Reſolution and Practice. <hi>I will not be angry, though an occaſion be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred.</hi> And let the return upon that Reſolution be the firſt act after the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation given: For if a Man can but bring
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152948:80"/>himſelf to this paſs, that he take not fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt offer, the Paſſion will cool: A Man calls then his Reaſon about him, and debates with himſelf: <hi>Is there cauſe I ſhould be angry? Or, is there any Good end attainable by it? Or if it be, what is the juſt medium, or ſize, or meaſure of Anger proportionable to that end?</hi> And theſe Conſiderations will break the firſt on-ſet of Paſſion, and then it ſeldom prevails: For, it is the firſt Wave that carries on the Perturbation to the end, which if it be broken at the firſt, Serenity of Mind is preſerved with much Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſenſe of advantage.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take up this Reſolution, never to give thy ſelf leave to be angry, till thou ſeeſt <hi>the juſt Dimenſions of the Provocation.</hi> Firſt, Learn whether there be any ſuch thing done or no: For many times we ſhall find that a falſe report, or a miſ-conception in the Mind, ſets up the Image of an Injury, and preſently the Paſſion ſwells upon it; when, it may be, upon a due examination, there is no ſuch thing at all. Secondly, Admit there be an injury, yet learn what the Circumſtances of it are: For till that be known, though thou haſt a mind to be angry, thou knoweſt not what Proportion or Meaſure of Anger to allow, till thou knoweſt the Meaſure of the injury done. It may be it is not ſo great;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152948:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>or it may be it was done by miſtake; it may be it was done upon ſome provocation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by thee, or at leaſt ſo underſtood; and then it is not ſo malicious: and it may be the Man is coming to make thee amends, or to ask thee pardon. This will give leaſure to thy Reaſon, to thy Grace, to come in; and will break the firſt ſhock, which the cholerick blood gives to the Heart, which raiſeth the combuſtion; and then a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one it comes to nothing, and either dies preſently, or languiſheth below the name of a Paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In caſe of <hi>Provocation</hi> to Anger <hi>by Words,</hi> conſider this, that there is nothing ſo much gratifies an ill Tongue, as when it finds an angry hearer: nor nothing ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints and vexeth it as Calmneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perturbedneſs. It is the moſt exquiſite and innocent Revenge in the World to return gentle words, or none at all to ill language. But on the other ſide, Anger and Perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not only produce what thy adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary deſires, but alſo puts a Diſcompoſedneſs and Impotence upon thee, that thou becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unable to keep ſilence, or to ſpeak with that reaſon and advantage thou ſhouldeſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IT is the <hi>great folly</hi> that ordinarily poſſeſſeth Men, eſpecially in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous condition, that they <hi>cannot ſuppoſe a change</hi> of their Eſtates: a living Man can hardly think of dying; a healthy Man can hardly think of ſickneſs; a Wealthy Man can hardly think of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; a Man in the Applauſe and Glory of the World, can hardly think of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diſgrace end Reproach.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this Difficulty ſeem to be theſe: 1. The preſent condition is a thing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152948:82"/>that falls under our preſent ſenſe, and takes up our whole conſideration: things that yet are not, are made preſent only by Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: and that, as it doth not ſo ſtrongly affect the mind, ſo there is a long operation that muſt precede before it can be brought home: a Man muſt conſider whether the State wherein he is, be changeable, and what may change it; and whether it may change for the worſe; or unto what degree of badneſs; and the probabilities or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of it; and ſo it requires a long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the mind, before a Man can bring himſelf under a ſuppoſition that his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may change, and change extreamly for the worſe. 2. When that ſuppoſition is received or admitted, yet it being but noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and imaginary, hath not the like ſtrength of impreſſion upon the mind, as that which is preſent and ſenſible; and ſo it ſoon paſſeth away, and hath not ſtrength enough to hold out for any time upon the mind, to work a due preparation and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the mind for a change. 3. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, when it is grateful to the ſenſe, we are for the moſt part willing to embrace and make the moſt of it: we have not patience to give an allay or abatement to our preſent fruition, by mingling any ſuch ſad conſiderations with it, as that it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152948:82"/>may change, when the mind begins to put it ſelf upon thoughts of a change of a belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved condition, ſuch replies as theſe do often meet with it: <hi>What? ſhall I be dying while I live? be Sick when I am Well? be Poor when I am Rich? be in Diſgrace when I am in Glory? make my ſelf Miſerable while I am Happy? it will be time enough to take and bear that Lot when it comes, and not to dye, or be in Sickneſs, Poverty and Diſgrace by anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I will take the benefit and ſweetneſs of my preſent happineſs, and not ſowre or abate it by the pre-apprehenſion of a change, if it happens, it will come before it's welcome. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think as little of it as I may before hand, and not make that preſent by a needleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which I would willingly be freed from, if it ſhould at all attack me.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like conſiderations do make Men rather procraſtinate the evil day, than put themſelves under the ſuppoſition of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Inconveniences</hi> that ariſe to the Children of Men, <hi>by this averſneſs from thinking of a change</hi> of a proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a worſe, are very great: 1. A mind, that oftentimes in a proſperous condition caſteth it ſelf in worſe by ſuppoſition and contemplation, doth ordinarily uſe his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition Warily, Moderately, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; but on the other ſide, this incogitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152948:83"/>of a change makes Men Preſumptuous and Confident in their Eſtate, Voluptuous, Imperious, Proud, Immoderate, Vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for they want that Correction that ſhould allay and diſcipline it into Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I am Rich, or in any other proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition, and begin to pride up my ſelf, and to take upon me; preſently a mind accuſtomed to aſſume upon it ſelf, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion, a contrary condition will preſently check that Pride and Vanity with ſuch a kind of expoſtulation as this: <hi>How unſeemly, Imprudent, and Vain is this? what if to morrow I ſhould be caſt down from my Greatneſs, or caſt upon my Bed of ſickneſs, or under the cloud of Diſgrace, or, it may be, taken away by Death? what will then become of this Immoderation? carry it along with me I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; for the change of my condition will not bear it; and if, with the change of my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I do, as I must, put off theſe Follies that attend me in this, that which is now my Exceſs, my Sin, will then be my Shame, my Sorrow and Vexation.</hi> 2. As a frequent pre-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of diſadvantageous changes tutors the mind to a right uſe of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſo it admirably fits a Man with ſuch a temper of Spirit, as becomes his changed condition: doth his change require Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to bear it, Contentedneſs under it, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152948:83"/>for it? He hath learned this in the Theory, and hath them laid up ready to be put in ure if the occaſion call for them: if there be no occaſion to practiſe them, they are no burthen; but if there be, he hath put himſelf to School to Affliction by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation before it comes, and is ready to exerciſe thoſe Vertues when it comes. But on the other ſide, a Man, that being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Proſperity, never puts himſelf under the ſad thoughts of a change of his preſent Happineſs, if ſuch a change befalls him, he is at his wits end; he is ſurprized, and overwhelmed with it; he knowes not how to bear it, but falls into Impatience, or his very Soul dies within him; he is taken before he is prepared, and none of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or rather diſtempers of mind, that were bred up upon his former condition, will at all ſerve the preſent, but do diſtract, and diſquiet, and perplex him; as his former Pride, Haughtineſs of mind, Greatneſs of Spirit, Intemperateneſs, Luxury, they are ſo far from being at all ſerviceable and uſeful to him, that they are as ſo many Haggs and Furies to torment him; and the things called Patience, and Contentedneſs, and Humility, and Calmneſs of Spirit, which are of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity for his preſent change, he knowes not how to attain or uſe. 'Tis a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152948:84"/>miſerable, or, at leaſt, a very great Improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a Man then to be learning thoſe Virtues, when the preſent neceſſity calls for the uſe of them: it is like a Thief, who is to learn to read, when he is to pray his Clergy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is therefore a moſt <hi>uſeful and neceſſary</hi> courſe for Men in Proſperity <hi>to take up the frequent Contemplation of their Change. Bilney,</hi> when the true profeſſion of the Goſpel in this Kingdom was under Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was uſed to put his finger into the Candle to inure himſelf the better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Martyrdom; which he at length ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, poſſibly with more Reſolution and Patience, than if he had omitted that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment. And ſurely this practice of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would be with more eaſe, and no leſs advantage, if in the time of our external Happineſs, we did ſometimes, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, take up ſuch ſerious Contemplations as theſe, both in reference to Death, and other external Afflictions: <hi>I am now</hi> alive and well, <hi>but I cannot but know that I am mortal and must dye, and my own reaſon, and every days experience tells me that my time is very uncertain and caſual: a ſmall distemper or diſorder in any little Vein or Artery, a little cold, a little meat undigeſted, may caſt me into a mortal Diſeaſe; a Crum going aſide, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152948:84"/>Air, the fall of a Stone on me, or of me upon a Stone, may ſuddenly take away my life. There are ſuch infinite Caſualties that may be mortal to me, that it is no wonder that I ſhould die, but it is that I live. What if it ſhould pleaſe God by any Diſeaſe or accident ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to call me to account for my Stewardſhip? are my Accounts ready? is my Peace made? are my Sins pardoned? is my pardon ſealed? is all as ready as it becomes that hour? if it be, well, if not, it becomes me ſpeedily to ſet things in order, eſpecially my great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for as this Tree of mine falls, ſo it will lie to all Eternity.</hi> Such thoughts as theſe, often and ſeriouſly iterated, would not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten a Mans death, but would much amend his life: it would put and keep the Soul in a right order and temper. <hi>Again, I am now in</hi> Health and Strength, <hi>free from Diſeaſe and Pains; if I am not out off by an untimely end, I muſt expect that Diſeaſe and Pains will lay hold of me; it may be, a burning Feavor, or a languiſhing Conſumption, or ſome ſuch Diſeaſe as may make the nights long, and the days troubleſome, every place uneaſie, all things I eat or drink inſipid, every Limb or Vein, Bone or Sinew contributing ſome Pain, or Weakneſs, or Faintneſs, or Anguiſh to the common stock of that Diſeaſe, which I muſt ſuffer. How am I furniſhed with Patience to bear it? can I amend
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152948:85"/>in my ſelf that Frowardneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquietneſs, Peeviſhneſs, and Impatience that I behold in others in the like caſe?</hi> Believe it, Sickneſs is not the fitteſt time either to learn Virtue, or to make our Peace with God: it is a time of diſtemper and diſcompoſedneſs: thoſe muſt be learned and practiſed before Sickneſs comes, or it will be too late, or very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, to do it after. <hi>Again, I am now abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with</hi> Wealth; <hi>but</hi> Riches <hi>many times make themſelves Wings and fly away; a Thief, or a Robber, a Plunder, or a Sequeſtration, a falſe Information, or a falſe Oath, the change of Times or Caſualties of Fire or War, Oppreſſion from thoſe above, or Tumult from thoſe beneath, the</hi> Chaldean <hi>or the</hi> Sabean, <hi>a Word or Action miſ-understood, miſ-apprehended, or miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and a Thouſand Contingences, may take away all my Wealth, So that I may ſtand and ſee my ſervants deſerting me, my Children utterly unprovided for, my ſelf in Extremity and Want, So that I, that have relieved Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, muſt be fain to gain Bread for my ſelf and my little Children, either by the ſweat of my own browes in ſome low Imployment, or by the charity of others: This may, and may be ſpeedily: Experience of theſe times have made it viſibly poſſible, wherein Thouſands, that never dreamt of a change, have unexpectedly felt it; can I come down to ſo low a condition with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152948:85"/>quietneſs and ſerenity of mind, without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt Providence, or Curſing, or studying Revenge upon the Instruments of it? Nay, can I entertain this change with Patience? nay, with Chearfulneſs? nay, with Thank ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, that he gives me my evil things in this life? if he be pleaſed but to bleſs my Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to me, and to reſerve my portion of Happineſs for the life to come? can I ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God? live upon him? and bleſs his Liberality, if he allow me and my poor Children a piece of Bread and a cup of Water? can I look through the darkneſs of my preſent condition, and behold that Hope of Eternity that is beyond it, and gather more Comfort in that Hope, than all the preſent Diſaſters can give Diſcomfort? If I can do this, my Loſs will be my Gain; if I cannot, it ſhould be my buſineſs in the time of my Proſperity, to lay up ſuch a ſtock and treaſure againſt the evil day, which will be above the Malice, and Power, and reach of Men and Devils to deprive me of. Again, I am now in</hi> Honour and Eſteem <hi>in the World, my Place makes me Eminent, and if it did not, yet my</hi> Reputation <hi>is fair and clear, and great, it may be I can without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or Ostentation own as much eſteem as</hi> Job <hi>doth in his</hi> 29 <hi>Chap.</hi> The young Men ſaw me and hid themſelves, and the Aged aroſe and ſtood up; when the Ear heard me, it bleſſed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152948:86"/>me; and when the Eye ſaw me, it gave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me: <hi>but for all this my condition may be changed, as his was, and my next Complaint may be with him, Chap.</hi> 30. But now they that are younger than I, have me in deriſion, whoſe Fathers I would have diſdained to have ſet with the Doggs of my Flock: and now I am their Song, yea I am their by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word. <hi>I may be branded with the Imputation of the highest Crimes; nay, my very Religion and Piety to Almighty God, and my Juſtice, Honeſty, and Fidelity to Men, may be covered with an Imputation of the baſeſt Hypocriſie and Diſhoneſty under Heaven, and though this part of my Reputation hath been my darling, that I valued highest of any thing in the World, and conſequently a blemiſh caſt upon me in this behalf would wound me deeper than any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſs; yet a conſequent of greater Importance would follow upon it, which I value higher than my Reputation,</hi> viz. <hi>The Honour of God, the value and eſteem of Religion, would be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through this wound; yet if this ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me, am I in a frame and temper of mind to bear it as I ſhould? can I be contented to ſit under Reproach and Infamy with Patience and Quietneſs of mind? can I content my ſelf with the ſecret witneſs of my own Conſcience, atteſting my Innocence, though the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under which I fit, are as black as Hell?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152948:86"/>can I chearfully make my ſecret appeal to the Searcher of Hearts, and pleaſe my ſelf with the Serenity of his Countenance towards me, though I am cloathed with Calumnies and Reproaches? can I wait his time for my Vindication, and content my ſelf, though the World never know my Innocence, ſo as my God and my Conſcience can attest it? if I have not arrived at this temper and pitch of mind, it ſhould be my labour to attain it; for without it I ſink under my Reproaches and Infamies, but if I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, then under the moſt dark and cloudy storm of undeſerved Reproach and Infamy I enjoy a</hi> Goſhen <hi>within my ſelf, I have a beam of light that follows me in the blackeſt night, and I Conquer my Reproaches by ſuffering them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But though this exerciſe, of putting our ſelves under Notional Afflictions, is of ſingular uſe to habituate and fit us for ſuch a temper as becomes ſuch a change; yet this is not all; <hi>Afflictions</hi> are <hi>not only</hi> Notional and <hi>Poſſible,</hi> but there is ſomething more in it; there is <hi>a greater Probability of them, than to be freed and exempt from them:</hi> they are not only under that degree of things that may be, but they come near to that degree of things that muſt be, and that <hi>in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of <hi>our Sin and Demerits.</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:152948:87"/>Although Afflictions many times are not principally intended as Puniſhments, but are ſent for higher ends; yet it is moſt certain, that they are deſerved to be inflicted as Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and are in their own nature a moſt neceſſary conſequent of Sin. They are not expiatory or ſatisfactory Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but they are moſt certainly Fruits and Effects of Sin: and worldly Croſſes and Calamities do as naturally flow from prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sins, as the Crop doth from the Seed that is Sown. Now in as much as every day I commit ſome Sin or other, it is no wonder if I reap the Fruits of it in Affliction: It is a wonder rather that I meet with no more Calamities and Croſſes in this World; and it is a Mercy if I meet with them only in this World, and not both in this and that which is to come. <hi>Wherefore doth a living Man complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sin?</hi> Certainly, though they were no Devil or Wicked Men to inflict Puniſhment upon me, as long as I carry Guilt and Sin about me, its no wonder if it raiſe ſtorms upon me: and therefore I have no cauſe to hope for an Immunity from Trouble, ſo long as I have no Immunity from Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of <hi>our Corruption,</hi> we have ſeen Troubles and Afflictions under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſideration, <hi>Sub ratione poenae,</hi> under
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152948:87"/>the nature of a Puniſhment; in this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>ſub ratione medicinae,</hi> in the nature of a medicine. The former ſhews ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Divine Juſtice to inflict them, the latter much of the Divine Mercy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them. The truth is, our Natural Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are very Many, and very Great; and for the moſt part they are moſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and dangerous when our condition is Proſperous; it is indeed the Fewel of our Corruptions. Pride, and Vain-glory, and Carnal Confidence, and Security, and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and Intemperance, and Inſolence, and Arrogance, and Forgetfulneſs of God, and of our ſelves, and of our Mortality, and of our Duty, and a Thouſand ſuch kind of Vermin do grow and thrive upon Proſperity. God Almighty therefore ſends Croſſes, and Afflictions, and Troubles, and thoſe to cure, and chaſe away, and ſtarve theſe evil Beaſts. And let any Man obſerve it either in himſelf or others, we are generally the worſe for Proſperity, and generally the better under Adverſity, what ever Sects or Profeſſions we are of: and it is a far greater difficulty to manage a Proſperous Glorious condition, than a low or Afflicted condition. Many times when I have read in the Scriptures, that Affliction is the Lot of the Righteous, and in the World ye ſhall have Tribulation,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152948:88"/>I have looked upon it not only as the Iſſue of the Devil and wicked Mens hatred, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as the Wiſe Diſpenſation of Almighty God to ſuffer it; for it is for their Safety and Benefit. Affliction doth in no ſort ſo much endanger a good Man to loſe his Innocence, Worth, and Virtue, as Proſperity, Wealth, and Honour do: and therefore I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thought that Man the ſecureſt from Afflictions upon this account, that uſeth his Proſperity with the greateſt Piety, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Moderation and Equality of mind; becauſe ſuch a Man keeps a check upon his Corruptions, and ſo ſtands in leſs need of this Phyſick: he is like a Man, that in his health keeps a good and orderly Diet, whereby in probability he ſtands in leſs need of a Corrective for Peccant Humours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As God, out of his Mercy to Good Men, ſends many times Afflictions to cure or allay their Corruptions; <hi>So the Devil or evil Men</hi> will be ſure to inflict them out of Hatred and Envy at their Graces, <hi>Marvel not if the World hate You, it hated Me before it hated You.</hi> And it is a great marvel, if any Good Man eſcape Afflictions upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: for if he be ſuch a one, as being in Proſperity ſets his Heart too much upon it, then the Devil and the World endeavours to deprive him of his Comfort, to draw him
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152948:88"/>to Murmuring, and Diſcontent, and uſing of unlawful Means, or unworthy Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, to preſerve that which he ſo much loves: or if he be a Man that in his Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity keeps his Heart in a right frame and temper, then the World or the Devil, being diſappointed in that condition, endeavours to ſhake him with the other extream: and though in reference to both, there is Envy, and Malice in the Devil inflicting, yet there is Mercy and Wiſdom in God permitting it: in reference to the former, for the checking and curing of this growth of Luſt, and Corruption; in reference to the latter, for the Tryal of the Sincerity of his Graces, as in the caſe of <hi>Job.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Another reaſon of the Neceſſity of Afflictions to Good Men, is <hi>to carry their Hearts upwards,</hi> and to make them reach af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Everlaſting Hope, and ſet a price upon it. The Good things of this World, though in our judgment we ſet not the like eſteem upon them as upon Heavenly, yet they have this advantage that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and therefore affect the Senſe and the Mind more than things that are better, at a diſtance: and therefore we are apt to ſet up our reſt here, And this is the reaſon that even Good Men, though they value and prize Grace and the inwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d favour of God,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152948:89"/>yet they commonly love the World a little too much; and divide their Affections too equally between God and the World; and therefore ſtudy and indeavour ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperation that they may hold both. And hence it is, that God, who requires intirely the Heart, doth many times make the world bitter to us, to make us weary of his Rival, that ſo we may with more Intireneſs and Integrity ſet our Hearts upon Him and upon that Everlaſting Hope, and long after and Integrity ſet our Hearts upon Him and it, and ſatisfie our ſelves with the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and make it our Treaſure, and ſet up our reſt upon it, and in it. And theſe are ſome of thoſe many reaſons that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Neceſſity of Afflictions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And now we will come to conſider theſe <hi>Three matters,</hi> 1. What Preparations we ſhould uſe before Afflictions overtake us. 2. What ſhould be our Exerciſe under it. 3. What ſhould be our frame of mind in caſe of Deliverance from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. And in the firſt place of the firſt of theſe; We have ſeen that it is a Lot to be expected in this World: we cannot upon any terms promiſe our ſelves an exemption from it; nay, if we ſhould eſcape all other Temporal Calamities; yet ſickneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Body will moſt infallibly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us: they are part of that black guard,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152948:89"/>that commonly attends death, which is the inevitable Lot of the living. It concerns us all therefore to be prepared for that, which muſt neceſſarily, ſooner or latter, be our condition, in ſome kind or other, it may be in many, it may be in all kinds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Therefore the firſt Expedient Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Afflictions is this: In the time of our Proſperity it muſt be our care to <hi>walk with as much Innocence, Watchfulneſs, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection as can be:</hi> for it is a moſt certain truth that the Malignity, and Sting, and Venome of Affliction is not ſo much in the things I ſuffer, as in the ſenſe of my former Guilt and Sin. No Man is in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to bear Afflictions, than he that hath the cleaneſt Conſcience: for, as any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in any part of the Body draws all the miſchievous and hurtful humours of the Body to that part, ſo it is a moſt ſure conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of any manner of Affliction, it brings all former Sins to remembrance, and calls the thoughts of them together upon ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. When <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren were under a ſtrait in <hi>Egypt,</hi> under the threatnings and ſeeming jealouſies of their unknown Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then comes in the remembrance of their injury to their Brother, and it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them with all the aggravations that can be, Gen. 42.21. <hi>We are verily guilty
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152948:90"/>concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul when he beſought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</hi> Conſcience, that they had before ſtifled and injured, now takes her time to be even with them, and flies upon them when they are in a ſtrait, and then ſhe will be heard, though in their Proſperity ſhe could not. And this Return of the Remembrance of former Sins is the very Gall of Afflictions; and that principally upon theſe two reaſons: 1. It is that which weakens and impares the ſtrength that ſhould bear them, for, for the moſt part all ternal Afflictions they concern the Body, or the outward Man, whether it be Poverty, or Reproach, or Sickneſs, or Pain; and if for all this the Mind be but free, ſhe will be able to bear them pretty well, will ſuggeſt Reaſons for Patience, Hopes for Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Twenty allayes, at leaſt to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the preſent ſufferings: but when that Mind, and Reaſon, and Judgment, that ſhould ſupport, is likewiſe wounded, and vexed, and tormented, with the ſenſe of paſt Sins, and the Storms that are within be as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and turbulent as thoſe without, there is nothing to bear up againſt the Afflictions; the Soul it ſelf, that ſhould ſupport the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, wants ſupport for it ſelf. 2. In
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152948:90"/>all external Troubles, as it is the Duty, ſo it is the Nature of Man to fly to God, and that application poſſibly gains Relief from it, but howſoever it bears up the Man with a convenient ſtrength againſt them: the very liberty of recourſe to God gains a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, a Hope, a Confidence, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in a very great meaſure under the Greateſt Troubles: but this Return of Sins paſt upon the Conſcience and Memory, if it doth not wholly deprive, yet it doth wonderfully interrupt, diſcourage, and divert the Soul from this moſt admirable expedient. When a Man ſhall have ſuch thoughts as theſe: <hi>I am under a very great Affliction either in my Eſtate, Friends, Name, Body, and I know no way to extricate my ſelf but one, and that is by application to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and Merciful God; and if I could but do ſo, I were ſafe: but alaſs! the Memory of my former Sins, my breach of Covenant with him, my frequent Relapſes into Sin, my Ingratitude to him, they fall in upon me, and I dare not, I know not how, I have not the face, the confidence to come unto him; and ſo I muſt lie and ſink under as well my Guilt, as my Affliction.</hi> And although this is a very falſe way of Argumentation and ſuch as is moſt diſpleaſing to God, and derogatory to his high Prerogative of Mercy, as well in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152948:91"/>as in delivering, who hath given to the moſt hainous Sinner, and under the greateſt Afflictions a Commiſſion to ask his mercy both to Pardon and to Deliver, and that with a Promiſe of Mercy; yet it is moſt certain, that, what by our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and what by the Devils ſubtilty, the Remembrance of our paſt Sins doth moſt ordinarily make our addreſſes to God under our Afflictions very difficult. Little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do people conſider in the time of their Proſperity, what a ſtock of Venom and malignity they lay up againſt an evil day by a diſſolute and ſinful life. Affliction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this moſt accurſed contribution were much more tolerable. If thou meaneſt therefore to make thy Affliction eaſie, keep thy Conſcience clean before it comes: thou haſt then the Strength of thine own Soul to ſupport thee, and the liberty of Acceſs to the moſt Mighty and Gracious God to deliver thee, when thou canſt in the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy Heart with <hi>Hezek.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3.</note> appeal unto God: <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> I ſay with reverence, keep God thy Friend in thy Proſperity, and thou mayeſt with confidence reſort to him, and relie upon him in Adverſity.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:152948:91"/>
                  <p n="2">2. But alaſs! when we have uſed all the Care and Induſtry, and Watchfulneſs we can, who can ſay he hath made his wayes clean before God? our Proſperity, and the Temptations that await us from without, and the Corruptions that are within us, give us often falls that we know of, and many more that we know not of: if therefore the neceſſity of our condition ſubject us to Afflictions, and the prevalence of our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſubject us to Temptations, what hope can I have to have a comfortable Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when I cannot hope to have an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Converſation? yet there is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to eaſe and lighten Afflictions: If thou canſt not be Innocent, yet <hi>be ſincere and upright Hearted,</hi> an Honeſt and Plain Heart, that holds no confederacy with any known Sin, keeps a quiet Conſcience even under Affliction it ſelf. If thou haſt not a perfect Life, yet be careful in thy Proſperity thou keep a perfect Heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet if thy Heart hath proved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful to thee, and thou hadſt fallen into any Sin, yet there remains one expedient to ſtop and anticipate the malignity of it from mingling with thy Affliction: Before Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions come, be ſure thou <hi>break of thy Sin by Repentance.</hi> Every Sin leaves a kind of Poyſon in the Soul, and there it many times
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152948:92"/>lies raked up till an evil day comes, and then it begins to work to ſome purpoſe: Sound and Serious Repentance fetcheth out this Core, this neſt of malignity; cleanſeth this Ulcer that Sin hath gathered. And leſt the malignity of Sin ſhould remain in thy Soul, when Affliction overtakes thee, be careful. 1. That thy Repentance be <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and iterated;</hi> and to that end let thy <hi>Examinations</hi> of thy heart and life be <hi>ſtrict and daily.</hi> Poſſibly thou mayſt find a Sin upon the review that thou didſt not before eſpie, that may deſerve a ſpecial Repentance: but if thou doſt not, yet thy Sins of daily Incurſion require a daily Repentance. 2. That thy Repentance, upon any known Sin committed, be <hi>Speedy</hi> while thou art in thy Proſperity; let it not lie upon thee till to morrow. Who can tell whether ſome bitter Affliction may not overtake thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt repented? and then that Sin will reach out its Venome and Malignity into thy Affliction, and make it worſe. Therefore intercept that accurſed influence of Sin by a ſpeedy Repentance. Thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will be the eaſier, and thy Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the lighter; thy Heart the ſtronger to bear it, thy Acceſs unto Heaven for Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the readier. When a Man lies under a Sin till Affliction come, he hath two great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152948:92"/>Suits to diſpatch in the Court of Heaven: Firſt, To gain his Pardon. Secondly, To gain Deliverance from, or ſtrength under Affliction. Be careful therefore to get the former diſpatched in thy Proſperity: thou haſt the leſs to do under thy Affliction. When Guilt and Affliction come upon a Man together, they add to each others weight and difficulty of removal: but Affliction meeting with a Conſcience cleanſed by Faith and Repentance is always tolerable, and for the moſt part Comfortable; it lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its nature, and becomes another thing; It is a prevention of Sin, a Corrective of Corruptions, an Exerciſe of Grace, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt, an Aſſurance of Gods love, a Preparative for Heaven, rather than an Affliction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Above all things <hi>be very careful that thy Affliction be not the just production of thy Sin or Folly:</hi> for in the one caſe thou ſuffereſt as an Evil Doer; in the other thou ſuffereſt as a Fool; and in neither thou canſt take any Comfort. If thou ſuffereſt without thy fault, or for thy Vertue, Piety, and Goodneſs, thou needeſt not be troubled for the one, and thou mayſt moſt juſtly rejoyce in the other: but to ſuffer as an Evil Doer, or as a Buſie-body in other mens matters, or for ill Language or Paſſionate Words, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152948:93"/>of the civil Power; theſe take away both the Comfort and the Glory of theſe Sufferings. Nay, though the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in theſe Extravagances, may poſſibly be good, and though the Puniſhment infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted excede the due proportion, and ſo hath ſomewhat of injuſtice or extremity in the infliction, yet ſuch a kind of ſuffering brings little Honour to God, little Peace to a Mans ſelf, and little Advantage to others; but rather the contrary. A Man that hath Sins about him hath ill Companions, and ſuch as abate the Comfort, even of an Innocent Suffering: but when a Man ſuffers for a Sin, or any unjuſtifiable Action, his ſufferings loſe the name of Afflictions, and become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, and in their own nature Puniſhments: and in ſuch a kind of ſuffering, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God brings Good out of it to the party that ſuffers, yet in ſuch, a Man doth not only undergo temporal Loſs, Pain and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, but hath the inevitable proſpect of his Fault and Offence in them, which makes the ſuffering the more bitter and diſtaſtful.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Be careful to bring thy ſelf <hi>to a right Estimate of the World,</hi> and the Good or Evil of it. Our over valuation of the World is that which makes us excede either in the Comfort we take in the enjoyments, or in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152948:93"/>the Perturbation that we ſuffer in the Loſſes or Croſſes of it: and commonly according to the meaſure of our Love unto, or valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things of this life, ſuch is the meaſure of our Grief or Sorrow, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency, or Anger, or Vexation that we entertain in our loſs or diſappointment in them: for indeed all other Paſſions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of the Mind are but the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids of the Paſſions of Love, or Love acted in a different ſhape or method, if I ſet too high a value upon my Wealth, or my Health, or my Honour, or my Relations, or my Credit, then my loſs or diſappointment of any of them will produce an Exceſs of Sorrow, or Vexation, or Deſpondency, or Anger, or Revenge. Therefore let it be thy buſineſs in the time of thy quiet and proſperity, in the firſt place to ſettle thy Judgment aright, and conſequently thy Affections aright, in reference to <hi>Externals.</hi> Conſider, firſt they are but Externals: they have no ingredient at all into the Man; a Man may be a Fool, or a Vitious and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, and yet injoy theſe things in a great meaſure: and a Man may be a Wiſe, a Juſt, a Vertuous, a Pious, a Man, a Man in the favor of God, and yet be without them. 2. They are in their own nature very uncertain things: they are ſubject to a Thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152948:94"/>nay, if they ſtand ſecured unto me with the greateſt ſtability that may be, yet my Body is ſubject to many weakneſſes and Diſtempers, and a Diſeaſe in my Body will render all theſe things inſipid and vain to me. What good or content will all my Wealth, my Honour, my fine Houſes, my great Retinue, my great Power, do me when I am in a burning Feaver, in a painful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, nay, under a fit of the Head-ach, or Stone? for ſo ſmall a Diſtemper will make me take no contentment or ſatisfaction at all, in all or any of theſe enjoyments, the truth is, they are but Proviſions for the Fleſh, and in order to the Body, and when the Body is under a diſtemper, they become but inſignificant uſeleſs things. He that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſtrong Pain or Diſeaſe finds as little contentment, though he lie on a ſoft Bed richly furniſhed, in a Chamber richly hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in it a Cupboard furniſhed with maſſie Plate, as if he lay in a Cottage. 3. They are but for a time, Death will at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, and as all my Riches, and Pleaſures, and Honours, and Worldly Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cannot prevent or buy it off, ſo neither will they be of any comfort or value to me in that hour. Indeed they may make death more troubleſom and unwelcome to me, but they cannot at all ſecure me againſt it. The
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152948:94"/>plain truth is, Death doth undeceive and open the eyes of the Children of Men; it teacheth us to put the true value upon every thing as it deſerves. <hi>My Riches and my Honour, my Pleaſures and my Profits, my Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and my Policy, which I made much reckoning of in my life time, when Death comes, I ſhall perceive them to be but Vanity at the beſt, and ſet no Eſteem upon them: but Piety, and Prayers, and Charity, and Intereſt in God, and in the Merits of Chriſt and the Promiſes of the Goſpel, that perchance in my life time I eſteemed as dry and uſeleſs things, I ſhall then ſee to be of greatest value, and accordingly prize them: Theſe I ſhall carry with me into the ſucceeding World; but all my Worldly Comforts, when I paſs through this ſtrait Gate of Death, I ſhall leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, as a Snake leaves behind his anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Skin when he paſſeth through a brake, and never make uſe of them, or take comfort in them more. And when I come unto the other ſide of this dead Lake, the Fruitions of all my life paſt will be forgotten, or at leaſt remembred as a Man remembers a Dream when he awakes; only the Good or Evil of my paſt life will ſtick upon me unto all Eternity. Why then ſhould I ſet my Heart upon that which is of ſo ſmall a value, ſo little uſe, ſo ſhort and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:152948:95"/>ſo uncertain a continuance? they are things which I may loſe while I live, but I am ſure I cannot keep them when I die; and if they take their farewel ſooner, they do but their kind, and at beſt, do but a little anticipate their laſt and neceſſary valediction. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve therefore I will not ſet my Heart upon them, but carry a looſe and flaccid Affection towards them: And if I loſe them, I will not over-much afflict my Soul for the loſs of that, which I had not much reaſon to value while I had it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as thus a Man ſhould tutor himſelf to a juſt Eſtimate of the Good things of the World; ſo a Man ſhould bring himſelf to a juſt and due Eſteem of the <hi>Evil things</hi> of the World, ſuch as Sickneſs, and Pain, and Impriſonments, and Reproach, and Want, and the like. There are theſe two things that do much allay the ſeverity of thoſe Evils. 1. They are but Corporal, they reach no farther than the Body, the Husk, the outward Man, the Cottage, they cannot at all get ſo deep as the Soul. 2. They are but Temporal: It is moſt certain that Death will cure and heal theſe Evils; and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly theſe Diſtempers and Sufferings, the leſs ſevere they are, the more tolerable; the more ſevere, the more in probability
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:152948:95"/>they will haſten and advance the cure: As nothing that hath an end can make a Man truly Happy; ſo nothing that hath an end can make a Man truly Miſerable; becauſe he hath under his greateſt Miſery the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive of Hope, and Expectation of a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But yet farther, <hi>Gain Aſſurance of thy Peace with God in Chriſt, and conſequently of thy future Happineſs;</hi> and be frequent in the Contemplation and Improvement of it. This is the great Engine of a Chriſtian, a Magiſtery, that was never attained by the moſt exquiſite Philoſopher, nor is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable but in, and by the knowledge of Chriſt, who brought Life and Immortality to Light: It is the great expedient whereby a Man attains Victory over the World; whereby he is able to injoy Proſperity with Moderation, and undergo Affliction with Patience.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.4.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the Victory which overcometh the World, even your Faith.</hi> When a Man, under the ſevereſt Afflictions, ſhall have this Aſſurance, and theſe Contemplations. <hi>It is true, I am in as low a condition as the World can caſt me; my</hi> Eſtate <hi>torn from me by the baſeſt of Men, and I and my Children expoſed to extream</hi> Want and Neceſſity, <hi>ſo that I am become little
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:152948:96"/>better than a Vagabond upon the Earth, for the very attaining of Bread; or at beſt am driven to the hardest and moſt ſordid imployment that can be conſistent with honeſty for my ſupplies of Neceſſaries, and if by chance my own ſweat or others charity ſupply me to day, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what ſhift to make for to morrow; and if this were a condition to which I had been born, or in which I had been bred, uſe might have made it eaſie and familiar; but it is not ſo, I am fallen into this low condition from a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and liberal condition, wherein I had my Table crowned with plenty; and as I wanted not Charity to imploy my Plenty, ſo I wanted not Plenty to ſupply my Charity. Again I was in the greateſt</hi> Reputation <hi>and Esteem among Men that may be, but now I am fallen under the ſaddest, the baſeſt, Scorn, and Obloquy, and Reproach, and Imputation that can be, and all this without any cauſe: my</hi> Enemies <hi>Triumph over me with Scorns, Deriſions, and Exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: my former</hi> Friends <hi>beſtow upon me a kind of Scornful Pity, that is more bitter than the upbraidings of my Enemies: the abjects and dregs of the people make me their by-word; and the</hi> Calumnies <hi>under which I ſuffer, are of ſuch a nature, that none dares be my Advocate, but the ſilent Teſtimony of my own Conſcience and Innocence. Again, under all theſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures it had been ſome allay, if I were but a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152948:96"/>of the World, that I had but the liberty to forſake the place of my ſuffering, and go to ſome more auſpicious or tolerable corner of the World; but in that I am alſo prevented, my</hi> liberty <hi>is taken from me, and I am penned up in the narrow, dark, loathſome, ſtinking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of a moſt odious</hi> Priſon, <hi>without the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Light, or Friends, or indeed of any other Company than ſuch as make my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the more intolerable, Chains, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the moſt accurſed Malefactors. Again, I ſuffer not only under reſtraint of a loathſome Goal, but I am expoſed to lingring Torments, Racks, and Whips, and Famine, and Nakedneſs, and Cold, and continual</hi> Threats, <hi>and ſad</hi> Expectations of worſe <hi>to follow, if worſe there may be. Again, diſmal and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and tormenting</hi> Diſeaſes <hi>ſeiſe upon my Body, no part of my Body free from pain, no place affords me eaſe, no Cordial gives me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, my Breath ſhort and painful, and even loathſome unto my ſelf, my eyes conſumed and weary with expectation of Deliverance, my Heart faint, and not able to ſupport its weak and languiſhing motion, my Stomach gone and not able to receive or digest the moſt pleaſant meat, my exhauſted conſumed Body standing in need of ſupply; and yet unable to receive it; my Intrails parcht and ſcorcht with burning heat, which is nevertheleſs the more increaſed

But, if under any or all of thoſe Preſſures I can, upon ſound grounds and aſſurance, reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Hope of Immortality, theſe and a thouſand more External miſeries will not only be tolerable, but eaſie: When I can

That Beam of Light and Comfort, that this Hope darts into my Soul, will inlighten my darkeſt Night here, and walk along with me to my</hi> Canaan, <hi>when my Hope ſhall be ſwallowed up in Viſion and Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the midſt of all the Storms and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Vilifyings that the World heaps upon me, I injoy the Comfortable Preſence and Favor of my God in my Soul, and his Suffrage, and Atteſtation, and Acceptance of my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which doth infinitely more over-ballance the Frowns and Contempts of the World, than the favor of the greateſt Prince doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the Reproaches of the baſeſt Peaſant. In the midſt of my cloſeſt and darkeſt Reſtraints, I have that converſe, which the ſtricteſt guard,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152948:98"/>the ſtrongest Bars cannot exclude: I have the Preſence and Converſation of my Saviour Chriſt, and his Bleſſed and Sacred Spirit, which doth cure and heal the noyſomneſs, and ſupply the retiredneſs of my cloſest Reſtraints; and this company makes my Priſon a Temple, wherein I can with his Bleſſed Apoſtle, with a chearful Heart, magnifie my God; my Soul and Mind is at liberty and free in deſpight of Gates of Braſs, and Bars of Iron. In the midſt of all my Pains and Sickneſs, and the tedious decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of my Body to its final corruption and diſſolution, I can ſatisfie my ſelf with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a happy Reſurrection, when this weak, and frail, and dying Body of mine ſhall be made like unto the glorious Body of my glorified Saviour, and tranſlated into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Saints and Angels, where there ſhall be no Sickneſs, nor Sorrow, nor Pain, nor Sin, nor Death, and I ſhall meet with thoſe Friends and Relations of mine, which died before me in the ſame hope. I look upon theſe my preſent Pains, and Sickneſs, and Weakneſs, as the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of that diſſolution, which ſhall put an end to them, and begin my Happineſs; and hereupon I bear them not only with-Patience, but Comfort (the greater their Violence is, the ſooner they will finiſh their buſineſs, and rend away this mortal corrupted Carcaſs from my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul,) and even in the inſtant of my
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:152948:98"/>diſſolution can, by the eye of my Faith, diſcern the Bleſſed Angels ready to tranſport my Soul, cleanſed by the Blood of Chriſt, into the joys of Heaven, and my Bleſſed Redeemer ſtanding on the other ſide, as it were, of this dead Lake, ready to receive me, and lead me into thoſe Heavenly Manſions of Rest and Happineſs, which he went before to prepare for me.</hi> This Hope and Aſſurance, as it makes the beſt things of this World, in their beſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and dreſs, but light and vain, and empty and nothing: So it makes the worſt things that the World and Mortality can inflict or ſuffer, light and eaſie. <hi>For theſe light Afflictions, which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: For the things which are ſeen are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but the things which are not ſeen are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be ſome of thoſe Preparations that will admirably fit and prepare us to meet with Afflictions, and in them theſe two things are to be remembred.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That we do not only content our ſelves with Notions and bare Speculations of theſe things, but that we may <hi>practically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest them</hi> into our Hearts and Reſolutions, for if they be but notional only Afflictions,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152948:99"/>when they come, will eaſily rend and defeat theſe Notions. I have known many Men, that have had very excellent Notions of this kind, and could diſcourſe excellently of them; nay, could urge them very effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon others, but when any little Croſs hath overtaken them, they have been quite out of all Patience and Comfort, and as much to ſeek how to entertain it, as thoſe that had never known any ſuch matter; nay, a poor experienced Chriſtian, that could not talk half ſo much, hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſhock of Affliction with much more Chriſtian Reſolution than the other; and the reaſon is, The former had digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Matters barely into Notion, and the latter he made it Practical and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial. When I read <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> I find excellent Inſtances and Reaſonings to ſupport the Mind in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and many times upon the ſoundeſt Grounds that can be. <hi>Plutarch de Animae Tranquillitate,</hi> tells us, That he that hath learned the Nature of the Soul, and thinks that by death it ſhall attain a better, or at leaſt not a worſe condition, hath a great freedom from fear of Death, and no ſmall <hi>viaticum</hi> to attain Tranquillity of mind in his life. And many ſuch inſtances are given by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Seneca,</hi> and by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152948:99"/>
                     <hi>Tully.</hi> But when the latter came to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite apprehenſion of his danger from <hi>Anthony,</hi> his Philoſophical Notions and Contemplations were too weak to bear up his mind againſt thoſe fears; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his Sixteenth Epiſtle, <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. to <hi>Atticus</hi> he writes to him to this effect: <hi>If thou hast any thing to comfort me, gather it up, and write it not out of Learning or Books; (for I have theſe here with me.)</hi> Sed neſcio quomodo imbecillior eſt medicina quam morbus: <hi>But, I know not how it comes to paſs, the Phyſick is too weak for the Diſeaſe.</hi> And <hi>Job,</hi> though a Wiſe and Experienced Man, and bore up pretty well in his Afflictions, yet his friend <hi>Eliphaz</hi> tells him, and that truly. <hi>Job</hi> 4.3, 5. <hi>Behold thou hast instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many, and thou haſt ſtrengthned the weak hands; but now it is come upon thee, thou faintest, &amp;c.</hi> Men may have excellent The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories to ſupport in Affliction, and can apply them to others in that condition with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular dexterity and advantage; yet when the caſe comes to be their own, their Spirits ſink under them, becauſe theſe Theories many times flote in the Underſtanding, but are not digeſted deeply, and practically in the Heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What ever you do, <hi>gain this Habit and Temper of Mind.</hi> Actuate and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:152948:100"/>your Faith, make even your Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, get your Peace and Aſſurance ſetled before Sickneſs comes: For a Man in any kind of ſuffering beſides, poſſibly may learn them, becauſe his mind is, or may be in his intire ſtrength; but moſt certainly Sickneſs is an ill time to begin to learn theſe Contemplations, unleſs they are learned before the Diſtempers of the Body diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Mind, and make it unfit to begin to learn. It is a time when that, which hath been before fitted and laid up in ſtore in the Soul, muſt be drawn out and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; but it will be a moſt difficult buſineſs, then to begin that Leſſon, which ſhould be learned in Health, though practiſed in Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Thus much for our Preparation, to meet Afflictions. Now concerning our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage under them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the beginning, and firſt Onſet of any Affliction, be very careful to <hi>keep the Mind in a due temper: Call in all your Aids of Reaſon, Religion, and Duty,</hi> to keep you in a right frame and temper of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for Affliction of any kind, when it hath lain a while upon a Man, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably bring him into order; but at the firſt Onſet the Paſſions begin to flie out, and play reaks, and diſorder the Soul, and fill it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152948:100"/>with Perturbation. Then immoderate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Murmuring, or immoderate Sorrow, or Fear flie out, and Men thereby become leſs able to bear for the future, and many times flie out into that Immoderation and Diſtemper at firſt, either in Thoughts, or Words, or Actions, that they are ſorry for after, and ſo draw upon themſelves a double trouble: Firſt to Repent of their folly and immoderation; and then to fit themſelves for ſufferings; it throws more grains of Sin into the Scale of Afflictions, and makes it heavier, and many times longer than otherwiſe it would be: And after ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation and Exorbitancy of Paſſion upon the firſt inroads of Affliction, a Man hath much ado to bring himſelf into a right and due temper. This was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, in the beginning of his Affliction he flies out into more Impatience and Diſorder, than all the reſt of the time; therefore beware and ſee thou keep thy mind in temper, and check Perturbation at the firſt Onſet, call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all thy Grace, and Reſolutions, and Reaſon, to keep thy mind in due temper at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, On the firſt Onſet of any Affliction, <hi>Lift up thy heart to God, deſire his Aſſistance and Grace</hi> to inable thee to carry a due temper and frame of Heart. This is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152948:101"/>not only thy Duty, and expected from thee by God; but it is a ſingular help to inable thee to avoid any preſent Diſtemper: For firſt it is a means to ſupply thee with more ſtrength from Heaven to order thy ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. 2. It brings thy Soul into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, before whom it were a ſhame to bring any Perturbation; the Paſſions and Diſtempers of our Minds are under an aw in his Preſence. 3. It is a diverſion of the preſent buſtle and ſtir that Paſſions are apt to make, and being diverted at firſt, they do not ſo ſuddenly, nor ſo eaſily fall into a diſorder. Commonly Paſſions are moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly and impetuous upon the firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And if they be then interrupted or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the ſuccors even of common Reaſon, much more of Grace, have opportunity to rally themſelves, and prevent Immoderate Perturbation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Make as ſpeedy an Inquiſition, as thou canſt, <hi>into thy own ſtate,</hi> and what the cauſe of this Affliction may be: <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways,</hi> is the voice of every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; and commonly every Affliction upon any perſon, that lies under any Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, and not forſaken, ſoon leads the Conſcience to point out that Sin; and indeed moſt Afflictions in ſuch a caſe carry upon them the very Inſcription of the Sin,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152948:101"/>and bear ſome Analogy or Proportion with it. <hi>Adonibezeks</hi> Cruelty, and <hi>Davids</hi> Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, were, as it were, written in the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they ſuffered, and might eaſily bring them to their remembrance. If thou ſuffereſt in thy <hi>Eſtate,</hi> conſider whether either Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Worldlineſs, and Covetouſneſs, or Confidence and Glory in thy Wealth went not before: If thou ſuffereſt in thy <hi>Name,</hi> conſider whether thy Reputation hath not been thy Idol, or whether thou haſt not born thy ſelf too high upon thy Reputation; and ſo of other Croſſes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If upon this inquiry, thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sin written upon thy Sufferings, or in the bottom of them, <hi>ſpeedily Repent</hi> of that ſin; Humble thy ſelf in the ſight of God for it, take up Reſolution againſt it. This is the voice, the injunction that this Rod gives thee, and here thy ſpecial duty is <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If upon ſearch, thou findeſt thy Heart and Conſcience clear, look upon this Affliction as a Diſpenſation ſent from God, and with all Humility <hi>ſubmit to his hand;</hi> and know that the moſt Wiſe God ſends it, for moſt wiſe ends, though thou ſeeſt not any Enormity in thy ſelf that might deſerve it. It may be it is to exerciſe thy Patience, thy Faith, thy Dependance upon him: It may be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152948:102"/>he diſcerns that ſome Temptation is like to meet with thee, or ſome Corruption is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thee, that thou doſt not perceive; and he ſends this Meſſenger to divert the one, and to prevent the other: ſtudy to improve this Affliction to that end, and here thy ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial duty is <hi>Patience and Vigilance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, But it may be, upon this ſearch, thou doſt find the true cauſe of thy ſuffering is for Righteouſneſs ſake, for keeping a good Conſcience, for the honour of thy Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for adhering to the Truth, and that this is the cauſe that ſtirs up evil Angels and evil Men againſt thee: and then indeed thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering loſeth the name and nature of an Affliction, and becomes an Honour, a filling up of the meaſure of thy Saviours ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, a ſuffering that hath not only a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in it, but it is a very Bleſſing it ſelf; for <hi>Bleſſed are ye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>if Men perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you for Righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> Suffering for or under a Sin committed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires thy Repentance and Humiliation, for it is a Judgment: Suffering without any Sin before hand ſignally requiring it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires thy Patience and Vigilance, it is an Affliction: but ſuffering for the Teſtimony of a Good Conſcience requires thy Rejoycing it is a Perſecution: But beware thy Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the not, and make thee believe thou
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152948:102"/>ſuffereſt for a Good Conſcience, when, it may be it is for thy Folly, or Frowardneſs: in this caſe, though they that inflict Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may want ſomewhat of that Charity and Moderation that is fit, yet thou haſt reaſon to repent for thy Folly, and not to Glory in thy Suffering; we are wonderful apt to believe well of our ſelves, and flatter our ſelves many times, into the title of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, when it is but the fruit of our Folly and Inconſiderate Raſhneſs.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Receive and bear all thy Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with Humility and lowlineſs of mind:</hi> for it is a Meſſage ſent to thee from the moſt Wiſe and Soveraign Lord of the World, though it may be by the hands of a moſt vile and unworthy Man. It was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper in <hi>David,</hi> that, when his diſloyal Subject curſed him, reſtrained the juſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his followers: <hi>Let him alone, it may be the Lord hath commanded him to Curſe.</hi> It may be the Inſtrument executes his own Malice and Spight, and it may be thou canſt not find any Signal cauſe of this Affliction even from the hand of God, yet be not Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive againſt the Inſtrument; he doth Gods Errand, though he vent his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: receive Gods Meſſage, and leave the Revenge to him that hath reſerved it to himſelf as his own Prerogative; and it may
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152948:103"/>be he will burn the Rod, when he hath done with it. Neither ſtorm at Gods diſpenſation, it may be thou haſt deſerved it, though thou doſt not ſee it; or If thou haſt not, give leave to thy great Soveraign to deal with his Creature, as he pleaſeth, and put thy mouth in the duſt.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>Receive it Thankfully,</hi> as well as Humbly. Know that it is ſent from the moſt Wiſe and Merciful God; what he doth, he doth upon moſt excellent Grounds and Reaſons. It may be it is Preventing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick againſt a greater miſchief: It may be it is for an Improvement of thy Grace; it may be it is intended, as an evidence, that thou art a Son, and not a Baſtard; it may be it is to wean thee from the World; it may be it is to fit and qualifie thee for a greater Bleſſing, and to give thee a capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bear ſuch a Benefit, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Preparation of an Affliction would make thee Proud; it may be it is to make thee an Example, a ſtrengthning to others; it may be it is becauſe thy Good things are reſerved for the better World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Evil things are diſpenſed to thee here. If God be thy Father, truſt his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, becauſe he is God, and truſt his Love, becauſe he is thy Father; and then thou canſt not doubt that any thing that he ſends
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:152948:103"/>deſerves thy Thanks though thou ſeeſt not wherein the Benefit of it lies: Be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein with an Implicite Faith, and be Thankful to him at all adventures. A Cup of Wormwood would not be reached to thee from ſo Wiſe, and ſo Good a Father, but that his Love and thy Benefit is mingled with the bitter Cup, though thou canſt not at preſent taſte the one or the other.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>Bear it Patiently and Quietly.</hi> 1. If it come <hi>for thy Sins,</hi> thou haſt reaſon to bear it patiently, for it is but the fruit of thine own Plant, the Crop of thine own Seed. <hi>Why doth the living Man complain? a Man for the Puuiſhment of his Sin?</hi> Thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it to thy ſelf, be contented to bear the iſſue of thine own way. 2. Bear it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for <hi>it might justly have been worſe,</hi> and more ſevere; thou wanteſt ſomewhat that another injoys, but haſt not thou ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that another wants? thou haſt loſt a conſiderable part of thy Eſtate, but haſt thou not ſomewhat left? or, if thou haſt loſt all, haſt thou not ſtill thy Health, and thy limbs, that may ſupply thy neceſſities by honeſt Labors? thou haſt loſt thy Limbs or thy Health, but doſt thou not injoy thy Senſes, and thy Underſtanding and Reaſon? thou haſt loſt thy Reputation, Honor, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:152948:104"/>Eſteem in the World, but haſt thou not thy Integrity and Uprightneſs? the Witneſs and Serenity and Peace of thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? thou haſt loſt many of thy near Relations, but haſt thou not ſome left? thou art viſited with Sickneſs and Pain, but haſt thou not ſeen ſome that have had more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and leſs ſtrength to bear them, and leſs hopes to be delivered from them, and leſs means to ſupport them? but ſuppoſe thou haſt loſt all thy Wealth, thy Reputation, thy Health, thy Friends, yet haſt thou not Peace with God? the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? the Aſſurance of his Favor? the Hope of Eternal Life? and wouldſt thou exchange this Hope for the return of all thy Temporal Comforts and Advantages? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, that Mans condition cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely miſerable, where there is any Hope, much leſs where there is ſuch a Hope, a Hope that out-weighs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the World can afford, or inflict; a Hope that is ſo much the nearer to fruition, by how much the greater thy External preſſures are, when thou doſt deſerve the loſs of all, thou haſt reaſon to be patient, if thou doſt injoy any thing; the Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Prophet is pathetical: <hi>Why doth the living Man complain? a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sin?</hi> Where there is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152948:104"/>Life, there is Hope; and for a ſinful Man to complain while he yet is living, carries with it the conviction of the unreaſonableneſs of his complaint; becauſe he injoys ſomewhat that yet he deſerved to loſe. 3. Bear it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, becauſe <hi>it is but ſhort,</hi> though it be never ſo ſharp, it may be that the ſame God that inflicted or permitted it, is at this inſtant reſolving to turn thy Captivity, to give thee Beauty for Aſhes: And what an unſeemly thing will thy Impatience be? How troubleſome will the remembrance of it be to thy Soul upon the change of thy condition? How much wilt thou be aſhamed at thy return of thy undecency of thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage under thy Affliction? I am perſwaded there was nothing more ſowred <hi>Jobs</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proſperity, than the remembrance of his former Murmuring and Impatience under the viſiting hand of God. But again, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy Affliction wait upon thee till thy diſſolution, yet it is but a Night, but an hour of Affliction: This Night, and this Hour will end with thy life; and this life of thine is but a Span, and then thy day will dawn, and thy Sun will ariſe, and thy Affliction will vaniſh and never return again. 4. Bear it patiently, <hi>Becauſe thy Patience will ſhorten thy Affliction.</hi> The Tryal and Improvement of thy Patience is one of the chief ends and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:152948:105"/>buſineſs of thy Afflictions: It is ſent to teach thee that Leſſon, and the ſooner thou learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it, the ſooner the buſineſs is diſpatched, and the Diſcipline diſmiſt: Thy Impatience doth but protract and lengthen out thy Diſcipline: If thou wouldſt be diſcharged of this importunate and troubleſome Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſpeedily diſpatch his buſineſs, and he is likely the ſpeedier to leave thee. 5. Bear it patiently, <hi>Becauſe thy Patience will make thy burthen the more eaſie and tolerable.</hi> When God ſends Afflictions to tame a Man, and bring him to a right temper, believe it, he will not be over-matched, he will bring thee down, and if one Affliction will not do it, he will add more, and make thy bond the ſtronger, and can and will yet viſit thee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venfold more, till he hath reduced thee to Patience and Humility: Struggle not with him, for he will be too hard for thee: If thou bear thy Yoke patiently, thou wilt bear it eaſily; but if thou fling and toſs, like a Wild Bull in a Net, thou mayeſt ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thy ſelf worſe, and thy Yoke will gall thee the more; but it will neither break the Net, nor the Yoke. Be contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Reſign up thy ſelf to his Will with Humility, and receive the chaſtiſement of thy folly with Patience, thou wilt have this double Advantage by it. Firſt, The great God
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:152948:105"/>will then lay no more upon thee, for he hath attained his end and purpoſe, by what he hath already inflicted; but will either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it from thee, or put his own hand to help thee to bear it. Secondly, By the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compoſure of thy mind, thou wilt be of greater ſtrength to bear thy burthen, and with more eaſe under it; for it is a moſt certain truth, That the turbulency, and ſtorming, and ſtrugling of the mind, is that which makes Affliction more ſharp and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, than the nature, or quality, or meaſure of Affliction it ſelf, it is the mind that gives the value and weight of external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity or Adverſity. Take two Men the one of a proud and great Spirit, as they call it, the other of a mild, humble, patient Spirit, we ſhall eaſily ſee that a ſmall diſgrace or loſs ſhall more afflict and torture the former, than Five times as much of either or both ſhall trouble the latter. And this is the true reaſon why Afflictions at the firſt are more troubleſome and grievous, than after, though they continue the ſame. At the firſt, they meet with a mind unacquainted with it, and conteſting againſt it, as a Heifer unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to the Yoke; but when by time and continuance, the mind is accuſtomed to it, though the Yoke be the ſame, yet it finds no ſuch ſeverity and importableneſs in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152948:106"/>it. A Patient Heart gains that habit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which cuſtom, length of time, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, doth with more difficulty produce in another temper. 6. Bear it patiently, becauſe thou haſt <hi>an Example of greater Patience,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a greater Croſs, in a moſt innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Thy Saviour hath left a Copy of his own Patience for thee to imitate; and thy Affliction is ſent to thee to teach thee to write after his Copy, and to conform thee to the Captain of thy Salvation, who was made perfect by ſuffering, conſider the diſparity of the perſons; He moſt innocent without any Sin to deſerve it: Thou a perſon laden with Sin, that meritoriouſly deſerves as much, if not more than thou haſt a capacity to bear: He, the Son of God cloathed with Innocent Fleſh, Thou a Worm cloathed with Impurity and Sin. Conſider the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of the Sufferings; He a Man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, under the Perſecution of thoſe whom he came to ſave, ſubjected to all the ſcorns and torments that the wit of moſt Exquiſite Malice could inflict, and above all this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe even of the wrath and ſeeming deſertion of his Father: Thou, it may be haſt loſt ſome Eſtate, or Reputation, or art in Priſon, or Baniſhment, or Sickneſs, or Pain, but under all this doſt or mayeſt injoy that Peace, and Pardon, and Favor of God
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152948:106"/>that his ſufferings purchaſed for thee: The ingredients of His Cup, nothing but Gall and Vinegar, but thy Cup, though never ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bitter, yet ſanctified and ſweetned by His Sufferings: And yet under all this, <hi>As a Sheep before his Shearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth;</hi> though his moſt Innocent Humane Nature ſhrunk at the pre-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this bitter portion, yet with Patience he reſigned up his Will to his Father, <hi>Not my Will, but thine be done.</hi> In ſum, as His Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was meritorious and expiatory for thy Sin, ſo it was left as a Patern and Example for thy practice. 7. Bear it patiently, <hi>For it is reached unto thee from the hands of God,</hi> though it may be by the hands of moſt vile and accurſed inſtruments, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is enough to tutor thee to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Patience. 1. It is the Diſpenſation of God, who is <hi>Infinite in Mercy and Goodneſs;</hi> and therefore it is moſt certain it is a Meſſage of Mercy; for <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men.</hi> Be ſure that it coming from the Fountain of Goodneſs and Love, it hath a Bleſſing in it, though thou canſt not at the preſent ſee it. 2. It comes from the Hands of the <hi>most Wiſe God,</hi> that doth all things for moſt excellent ends, and even in thoſe Diſpenſations that are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and rugged, that we cannot unriddle,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152948:107"/>yet there is always a complication of moſt Soveraign and Excellent deſigns, which ſhall not be diſappointed. 3. It comes from the hands of that God, that is under the relation of <hi>a moſt tender Father,</hi> that hath the very ſame Bowels of Mercy, Goodneſs, and Love to us, in his corrections, as in his favors. A poor ſilly child, when a Father either corrects him for a fault, or takes that from him that will hurt him, or keeps him hard to his Book, or other imployment, or denies him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is noxious to him, thinks his Father deals hardly with him, when in truth the very ſame tender and Fatherly love, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf in more grateful diſpenſations, is the cauſe and companion of theſe. The ſame is thy caſe and mine, be patient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it is the hand of a Father that afflicts thee; and that may aſſure thee that it is for thy good, and it ſhall be in meaſure. 4. It comes from that God, that is <hi>thy abſolute Lord,</hi> that hath that unlimited right over his Creature, that his only Will is a ſufficient rule of his Juſtice, thou oweſt an infinite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, from whom thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thy Being: His Soveraignty over his Creature is even by the very right of Nature Infinite and Boundleſs. Be contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bear whatſoever he inflicts without the leaſt diſputing of the Juſtice or Injuſtice
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152948:107"/>of it. This was that Excellent Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of old <hi>Eli,</hi> under the moſt ſevere denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of Gods judgment. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> And it was that great Leſſon that <hi>Jobs</hi> Afflictions was ſent to teach him, though he could not learn it, till God himſelf, as well for our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as His, taught him out of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; but then he learned it, and abhorred himſelf in Duſt and Aſhes for his former Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Frowardneſs. 8. Yet further, bear it patiently, for that <hi>God,</hi> that ſent thee this Meſſenger <hi>doth behold and obſerve how thou entertaineſt it;</hi> wherein we may with all due Reverence, ſuppoſe the Lord of Heaven, thus reſolving. <hi>Yonder is ſuch a Man that profeſſeth to Know, and Fear, and Love me, and I ſee him nevertheleſs fond of his Wealth or Honor, or ſome other Bleſſing; I will give leave to Evil Men, or Evil Angels (as once in the caſe of my Servant</hi> Job) <hi>to ſpoil him of Wealth, and to cast him into Diſgrace; and I will obſerve his carriage and deportment under it; and though I know what it will be, yet I will make it now conſpicuous both to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Men, and Angels: And if his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment be not anſwerable to his Profeſſion, if he storm againſt my Providence, or uſe unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Means to free himſelf, or grow Impatient and Diſorderly under it, I will make his folly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152948:108"/>conſpicuous, and ſend more and ſharper Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto him, till this fire of Afflictions hath brought him to his due temper of Patience, Humility, Submiſſion to my Will, Dependance upon my Power, Subjection to my Soveraignty: But if on the other ſide, I ſee him humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under my hand, Submit to my will, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me in his Sufferings, Patient under them, and Waiting my time to be delivered from them, I will exhibit him before Men and Angels as a Patern of Patience, and I will make him as Signal in his Deliverance, as he is Eminent in his Patience.</hi> Suppoſe thou couldſt hear ſuch a Deliberation, and ſee and behold ſuch Spectators of thy Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how wouldſt thou indeavor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy ſelf with all Patience, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs, and Quietneſs, and Reſignation of thy ſelf under the moſt ſevere Affliction? And how little wouldſt thou dare in ſuch a Preſence to diſcover, or ſo much as entertain any Murmuring or Impatient thought? Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy ſelf, though thou canſt not with a bodily eye behold this Great Lord of the World beholding thee, while thou art in this Scene of Affliction, yet he beholds and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves thee, and the very motion of thy Soul, and the Glorious Angels, though they cannot look into the ſecret retirements of thy Thoughts, yet they behold thy exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152948:108"/>Deportment, and are grieved, if it be unſeemly, and unſuitable to the Honor of their and thy Lord, and are glad to behold a Deportment ſuitable to the Ends and Glory of their Lord: And the Evil Angels, which irritate and provoke thee to Impatience, are pleaſed and gratified if they effect it, and aſhamed and vexed if they are diſappointed in it. Believe it, in a ſignal and eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Proſperity or Adverſity thou art like a Man upon a Stage, a ſpectacle expoſed to the view of God, and Men, and Angels, and Devils; let thy carriage therefore be ſuch, as if thou didſt as viſibly behold thy Spectators, as they moſt certainly do ſee thee.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, As thus thou art to bear thy Affliction patiently, ſo indeavor to <hi>uſe it profitably;</hi> and beſides theſe advices before mentioned, add to them theſe inſuing. 1. <hi>Learn</hi> by them to have a <hi>juſt Eſtimate of the World.</hi> Affliction pulls of thoſe fine gay Cloaths from the World, by which in Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity it deceives us, and renders it, as it is, a Vain, Empty, Vexing World. 2. From that ſound and juſt Eſtimate of the World, <hi>Diſcipline thy Affections to a moderate and looſe application to it.</hi> It is true, Afflictions do ordinarily imbitter the World to us, and ſo for the preſent our Affections may be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152948:109"/>dull towards it; but this ariſing meerly from Senſe, without a ſound practical eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Judgment, it ordinarily laſts no longer than the Afflictions laſt, and as they wear away, and worldly comforts begin to grow up and increaſe, ſo our love to the World comes on, and grows up again: But when a Man by the advantage of Afflictions digeſts this principle into his Judgment, commonly it abides and moderates the love of the World, notwithſtanding the return of the Comforts and Advantages of the World. 3. <hi>Keep up thy heart in a dependance upon Gods Power and Alſufficiency to deliver thee from Affliction, or to ſupport thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it;</hi> and labor by Obſervation and Experience to rivet this Dependance into thy Judgment and Choice. It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that almoſt every Man, as long as he can have any thing to lay hold of beſides, will make that his Dependance: The Sick Man will depend upon his Phyſician; the Impoveriſhed Man upon his Friends, and the like; but when there is nothing elſe to reſt upon, then Men will to their Prayers, with the Mariners in the Storm; but this being but an Act of Neceſſity, as it riſeth upon Neceſſity, ſo it vaniſheth with it: When the Neceſſity is over, and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances come to hand, we are apt to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152948:109"/>throw off our Dependance upon God. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor therefore for an Experimental and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Dependance upon God: Sometimes in Afflictions we begin to attain it; but the beſt way is to begin to entertain ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance before we are driven to it; and then the Neceſſity of our Afflictions will faſten and improve it, that it will ſtick with us after. 4. <hi>By thy Afflictions learn to value and improve thy Hope and Aſſurance of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life:</hi> And indeed thy Neceſſity now doth in a ſpecial manner drive thee to it; and it is a great End of Gods ſending Afflictions, that it may drive us off from the claſping of this preſent World, and thereby carry us over to the valuation of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Condition: Thy Wealth is gone, and thy Honor and Reputation is ſunk and blaſted, and thy Friends have forſaken thee, and thy Body is mouldering to duſt and rottenneſs, and thy Soul ſits hovering upon thy Lips ready to take her flight, and all thy hold of this preſent life is broken and gone, ſo that thou haſt nothing now to lodge and faſten thy Hopes upon, but the Promiſes of Everlaſting Life, thy intereſt in Chriſt, the Hope of Everlaſting Life, and now, if ever, theſe things will be welcome to thee. God hath ſcattered and broken all other Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; improve this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Magnum,</hi> this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152948:110"/>one thing neceſſary, that alone doth ſtand by thee, when all things elſe forſake thee, and will accompany thee in and through Death it ſelf; and fix in thy Heart ſuch a value upon this that hath been thy only Comfort, when all others forſake thee, as not to let go thy valuation of it, though thy Temporal Proſperity ſhould return unto thee.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Wait Gods leiſure for thy Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of Afflictions, and uſe no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Means to be delivered from it.</hi> Uſe no baſe or unworthy Compliances with the World, either by diſſimulation or flattery, or violence, or falſity, to extricate thy ſelf; for that will either intangle thee worſe, or at leaſt and Guilt to thy Sufferings. And above all, avoid that accurſed temptation of ridding thy ſelf from thy Troubles by <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an End to thy own life;</hi> for thereby thou doſt at once two great Evils; an Evil of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream <hi>Folly and Madneſs</hi> to exchange a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Inconvenience by running the hazard of an Eternal Miſery; for the very ſame Impatience and Perturbation and Anxiety of Soul, that puts thee upon ſuch an accurſed Reſolution, goes with thee into the other World with a great improvement of it, and makes thy Soul in its Separation infinitely more vexed and tormented than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:152948:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Body; and an Evil of <hi>Rebellion against God,</hi> who hath ſent thee theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and hath made it thy Province, and thy Task, and thy Service, that he injoyns thee, to bear with Patience, and to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor till he deliver thee. Thou art juſt like an hired Servant, who art ſet on work by a moſt righteous Lord, and thy labor ſet out to thee, and thy Reward appointed in the end of thy day, and thou wilt run away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day be ended, whereby thou doſt not only loſe thy Wages, but art juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to be purſued and caſt into Priſon for thy Diſobedience and Rebellion: Be contented, wait Gods time with Prayers and Patience, and thou mayeſt be ſure to find his Mercy in moderating thy Afflictions, his Power to ſupport thee under them, his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his time, which is always the beſt time, to deliver thee from them, and his Bounty to reward thee for thy Patience and Obedient bearing of them.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, Take this for a moſt certain expedient to be prevented from many Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and to be delivered from them: <hi>Meddle as little with the World, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Places, and Advantages of them, as you can;</hi> and extricate thy ſelf from them as much, and as ſoon as thou canſt. Although the Divine Wiſdom and Providence governs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:152948:111"/>the World in a moſt infallible and unerring method, yet in the External Adminiſtration of it, it ſeems to be full of confuſion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty: When I have ſeen a <hi>Lottery</hi> with a goodly ſhow of fine Plate, and a great many perſons parting with certain money for an uncertain Lot, and though poſſibly one or two may gain a fair prize, yet a Hundred for one drawing nothing but blanks, and when they have opened their Papers vexing and tormenting themſelves with their Loſs and Diſappointment; or, when I have ſeen at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> time a few Apples thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a Room full of Boys, and one ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and another catching, ſome getting nothing but a fall, or bruiſe, or a broken Shin, or a broken Limb, and another getting it may be two or three, and thoſe that miſs falling upon him that hath gotten; ſo the company fall together by the Ears: Or, when I have ſeen a match at <hi>Footbal,</hi> one while one getting the Ball, and then another kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his heels and getting it from him, and then another doing the like by him. Theſe give me a kind of <hi>Reſemblance of the World,</hi> wherein, though by the help of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there are certain Rules put to the Game, yet they are not always kept, and when they are, yet it is not without a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Irremediable Deceit and Violence, though it be of a finer ſort.</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:152948:111"/>
                  <p>If now my Child ſhould run among this Company, and in the ſcuffle ſhould receive a knock, or a fall, or a bruiſe, or be tumbled in the dirt, and then ſhould come running to me, and complain of his uſage, my anſwer would be to him, What made you there? What made you in ſuch boiſterous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Company? If you mingle with ſuch Company, you muſt be contented to ſhare in the prejudice, and to take your Lot; it is the Play, if you diſlike with your ſucceſs, come no more among them. And indeed, this is in a great meaſure the caſe of many of the true Children of God, they ſee fine gay things in the World, as Wealth, and Honor, and Place, and External Advantages ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Children of Men, and gotten by ſcrambling for them, and ſometimes are apt to flatter themſelves into the purſuit of them, with a pretence that if they could come by their ſhare of them, they would do more Good with them than thoſe do that get them; or, at leaſt, they think it as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and as fit for them to have them as others; and thereupon they thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Crowd and Scramble for them, or are, at leaſt, couſened into an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of them; and poſſibly they are roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tumbled into the dirt in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and it may be miſs of them when
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:152948:112"/>they have all done: But ſuppoſe they gain them, then they think they may keep them, and yet keep their Conſcience and Integrity and Religion too; and many times in that indeavor they loſe ſomewhat of their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and then God viſits them with ſome Loſs or Reproach; or in caſe they ſtand to their Integrity, and will not part with it, but will make a ſcruple of things that others down with, then commonly they are expoſed and pillaged, and loſe all that they have thus gotten, and the Evil one, and Evil Men tell them, <hi>Nay, Sir, if you come into our ground, if you will hold the World, pray be contented to hold it upon our term, and as we do, or elſe leave it; it is part of the game.</hi> And then the Man complains of his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his hard Uſage in the World, and that he ſuffers for keeping a Good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and if he would have done as the reſt of the World do, it had been better with him. <hi>But Sir, what made you in that Company? What made you to be tampering with great Places and Preferments? Do not you know, that if you will be dealing and trafficking with theſe kind of matters, you muſt take them upon thoſe conditions the World doth uſually afford them? Do not you know that by medling with them, you liſt your ſelf in a manner under the Worlds command, put your
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152948:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſelf into that Corporation? And therefore if you are minded to hold theſe Temporal Advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, you muſt obſerve the Orders of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and ſo hazard your Conſcience and Peace with God? And if you will not obſerve the Orders of your Commander, you muſt be contented to be ſubject to the Diſcipline, and Frowns, and Scorns, and Rejections of the World; for you cannot ſerve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Therefore if thou wouldſt prevent or avoid very many Afflictions, mingle as little as is poſſible, with the concerns of the World, eſpecially in great Places; and if through inadvertency or importunity thou art drawn into the ſcuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le and intanglements of the World, get out as ſoon as thou canſt ſafely, and fairly, and honeſtly: For it is a Thouſand to one but, firſt or laſt, thou ſhalt otherwiſe hazard thy Conſcience, or receive ſome ſcratches and worldly prejudices, which are in truth rather the Iſſues of thy Folly, and Inconſiderate Adventure, than true Affliction.</p>
                  <p>But for medling with <hi>Places of Magistracy, Honor or Publick Imployment,</hi> I would not have it thought that it is my intention that Good Men, awfully called, and duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, ſhould moroſely or frowardly wholly reject their due call unto them. The World cannot be kept in order without
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152948:113"/>Magiſtracy: and Good Men, if otherwiſe fitted for it, and duly called unto it, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to adminiſter it beſt for the Publick good of Mankind: and it were an unreaſonable thing for them to expect the benefits of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and Government from others, when under ſuch circumſtances they wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the communication of the like advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to others: and therefore the wiſeſt Kingdoms, States and Politicians have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a neceſſity upon Men of honeſty and abilities to take upon them Publick Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>Aristot.</hi> 2. <hi>Politicorum,</hi> although he condemns Ambition after Magiſtracy, [that Men ſhould be incouraged or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſtand or ſolicit for places] <hi>Nemo enim Magistratum petet, niſi Honoris ſit affectator: atque pleraque eorum quae homines injuſte faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, per Ambitionem &amp; Avaritiam committun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> yet tells us, <hi>Oportet enim &amp; volentem &amp; non volentem ad Magistratum aſſumere, ſi dignus ſit eo Magiſtratu.</hi> That therefore which I mean is, 1. That Men that love their own Peace and Tranquillity ſhould not ſeek great Imployments, 2. That if they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they do, as far as conſiſts with modeſty and duty to their Superiors and Country, decline and avoid them: 3. That if upon ſuch an account they are perſwaded to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake them, yet they be ſure that before
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:152948:113"/>they undertake them, they have ſufficient abilities to perform them. 4. If by the Command of the Soveraign Power they are required to undergo them, and are able and fit for the Imployment, they do not either frowardly or ungratefully refuſe them: For 1. Herein they are but paſſive; it is an act of their Submiſſion and Duty, not of their Choice. 2. Being thus called to it, if they meet with any rubs in their way, they have no reaſon to blame themſelves, ſo long as they obſerve their duty in the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; The Prince that injoyned them to this Province, is to be their ſupport in it. 5. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and Chearfully to entertain a diſmiſſion from it when it pleaſeth the Prince to call them from it, or when by reaſon of diſabling occurrences they may fairly attain ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And thus I have done with ſome of thoſe principal Conſiderations touching our Deportment under Afflictions; now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the frame and temper of a Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our <hi>Deliverance from them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Accept of thy deliverance with all <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to God, <hi>and Humility</hi> in thy ſelf. Attribute it wholly to his Goodneſs and Mercy; Think not that thou art delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red becauſe of thy Worth or Deſert; for any one ſin that ever thou committeſt would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:152948:114"/>detain thee Everlaſtingly under the ſevereſt Affliction: Think not thy Affliction hath expiated thy Demerit, and that thou oweſt thy Deliverance to the ſatisfaction that is made by thy ſuffering; for moſt certainly the greateſt Affliction under Heaven cannot ſatisfie for the leaſt Tranſgreſſion; nothing but the Blood of the Son of God can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the weight of the leaſt Sin againſt God: Think not that thy Deliverance is due to thy Wit, Friends, or Intereſt; for though God be pleaſed to uſe the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Means, yet he Adminiſtred that Means, and Bleſſed that Means, and made it effectual; or otherwiſe it would have been but a flat and unprofitable Means. As God ſends Afflictions to evidence his Power, and Wiſdom, and Soveraignty; ſo he ſends De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to manifeſt his Goodneſs and Bounty: and the Tribute that he moſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expects for the ſame, is but eaſie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable: <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will Deliver thee, and thou ſhalt Glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Forget not the time of thy Trouble, and the promiſes and ingagements that thou didſt then make.</hi> We obſerved in the beginning of this Diſcourſe the difficulty of Pre-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Adverſity before it comes; and truly it is almoſt as hard to think of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152948:114"/>Adverſity when it is paſt. We pleaſe our ſelves with what we enjoy, and never reflect upon what is paſt, unleſs it be to heighten and advance our preſent enjoyments: and if we do chance to think upon the ſerious reſolutions we then entertained, we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as the weak reſults of our Infirmity, uſeful indeed for that time, but now anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated and grown unſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not only call to mind thy Promiſes, but <hi>call them to mind with a Reſolution to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and perform them,</hi> in ſuch expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe: <hi>Alaſs! the time was when I was under great Afflictions, it may be of a painful and a deſperate ſickneſs, and then I reſolved, if God would reſtore my health, I would walk more ſtrictly with him; I would pray more frequently, and more constantly, and more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently than formerly; I would be more diligent to make even my Accounts with him, to make ſure my Calling and Election, for which I found the time of my Sickneſs was very unſeaſonable; I would redeem my pretious Time, and value thoſe minutes of life, that God ſhall lend me at a dearer rate than formerly; I would neglect no opportunity of doing Good to others, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving my Everlaſting Peace; how pretious then was one hour of repoſe and quietneſs, and freedom from pain? and how much ſhould I then have valued it? and how induſtriouſly
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152948:115"/>ſhould I have then improved it in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of my Everlaſting Soul? God hath now heard my Prayers, reſtored my Health, put that pretious Opportunity into my hands of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Vowes and Promiſes, which I then made in the ſadneſs of my Soul, and ſhall I deal falſly in my Covenant, diſappointing my God that hath delivered me? No, I will up and be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I will Perform all my Vowes to him: nay, the ſenſe of the Mercy and Condeſcention of God to my requeſts ſhall increaſe my Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before him; As he hath added Mercy to me, ſo I will add new Obligations to my ſelf of better Obedience, and farther Duties than the ſenſe of my Miſery could ſuggeſt unto me, or draw from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Be very Watchful over thy ſelf,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Saviours Counſel, <hi>Go away and Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing befall thee:</hi> and in a ſpecial manner recollect and call to mind thoſe Sins that did moſt trouble and diſquiet thee in the time of thy Adverſity; renew thy Repentance for them, and take a ſpecial care to avoid Relapſes into them; Remember the miſchiefs they then did thee, and let them know they ſhall do thee no more: be moſt ſevere and ſtrict againſt them.</p>

A ſuppoſition of a former Miſery or Viſitation: 2. A preſent injoyment of a freedom from that Miſery. Therefore if any Corruption or Temptation unto Sin ſollicite thee, improve this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to this or the like effect: <hi>I was lately under the Rack, under the Rod, under extream Want, Impriſonment, Diſgrace, Loſſes, Sickneſs, Sorrows, Fears, and an imminent expectation of the worſt of Evils; and though theſe were ſore and ſharp Afflictions, yet the ſenſe of my former Sins, and the importunate restleſneſs of that Guilt, that was contracted from them, were more bitter and tormenting than all the reſt of my ſufferings; it was that which was the ſting and venome of all my Afflictions; and it hath pleaſed Almighty God to accept of my Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to remove my Afflictions, and to give me Beauty for Aſhes, and ſhall I be ſo very a fool as by committing of a new ſin to run the hazard of another plunge, another ſcourge? which in all probability muſt be much more ſevere than the former, becauſe it would be the Iſſue not only of Sin, but of Preſumption, a Sin committed againſt the experience that I have had of the bitterneſs of Sin; and with what face or hope could I expect any poſſibility of Deliverance from a ſecond Relapſe into Miſery occaſioned by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152948:116"/>ſo Deſperate a preſumptuous relapſe into Sin? But ſuppoſe it were poſſible, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my yielding to this Temptation, I might eſcape the Vengeance, yet can I be ſo falſe, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to that God, that hath delivered me from my Sufferings and from my Fears, as to recompence his Love and Mercy, and Goodneſs with a Preſumptuous Apoſtacy from him? ſhall I thus requite his Mercy and Goodneſs, that heard me in my Anguiſh and Sadneſs of Soul, in my Extremity and Miſery, and ſo heard me that he hath delivered me out of all my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Miſeries?</hi> Certainly, if either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence, or common Ingenuity be left in a Man, the ſenſe of a former Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ſenſe of ſo great a Mercy, will make a Man abhor the leaſt ſubmiſſion to that Temptation that may at once hazard the continuance of his preſent Comfort, and cannot be entertained without the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous rejection of him, that thus Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully ſent Deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152948:116"/>and let Prudence bind thee to it, thou knoweſt not how ſoon thou mayſt have the ſame neceſſity again, and where canſt thou find ſuch a friend? The truth is, when we are in extremity and have no whither elſe to fly, O then we run to God, and we pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and promiſe him fair: but when once our turn is ſerved, and we have gotten our ends, and think our ſelves out of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, we are like Mariners after a Storm, and God hears no more of us: but this is, as extream Ingratitude, ſo, extream Folly. Oh keep thy God thy Friend, for moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, thou wilt have occaſion to uſe him again, and thou knoweſt not how ſoon: keep thine intereſt in him, and eſtrange not thy ſelf from him in thy Recovery, whom thou canſt not be without in thy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As I would have thee recollect what were the things in thy life paſt that moſt troubled thee in thy Affliction, that ſo thou mayſt avoid them; <hi>ſo think what things or practices, or expence of time in thy life paſt was moſt Acceptable and Comfortable to thee in thy Affliction,</hi> that ſo thou mayſt practiſe them after thy reſtitution.

And I dare appeal to any Mans <hi>Experience</hi> under Heaven, that when the former ſort of Tranſactions of our lives were either extreamly bitter, or at beſt very inſipid, to his remembrance, yet the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theſe of the latter ſort were moſt Comfortable and Contenting. Thou art now recovered, it is true, but as ſure as thou ſhalt dye, ſo ſure thou ſhalt paſs through new Afflictions, though it may be not of the ſame kind, yet of ſome kind: let it be thy care, after God hath thus delivered thee from thy former Affliction, to lay up a ſtock of Good Works againſt another Evil day; ſuch Cordials will lie warm at thy Heart, even when the cold pangs of Death it ſelf ſhall be ready to invade and ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and the Comfort of them ſhall paſs into the other World with thee.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Though the portion of thy life before thy Affliction and under it, were very well ſpent, yet remember that the Mercy of God in thy Deliverance doth call upon thee for

                     <hi>a farther degree of Goodneſs and Perfection</hi> than thou hadſt before: it calls for more Humility, and more Thankfulneſs, and more Heavenly Mindedneſs, and more Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and more Devotion, and more Self-Denial, and more Sanctity, and more Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie for the Honour of God, For 1. On Gods part, thou haſt more Ingagements and Obligations put upon thee than before: Every increaſe of Mercy calls for an increaſe of Duty. 2. On thy own part, thy Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences are greater, thou haſt paſt through the School of Afflictions, and that is a ſeaſon wherein God opens the Ear to Diſcipline, the Rod hath a voice and a leſſon to teach; and thou haſt paſt through the experience of Gods Goodneſs, Tenderneſs, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in thy Deliverance, and that tutors thee to more Dependance upon him, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him, and Love of him, and theſe affections carry out the Heart to Duty and Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Beware that after Deliverance from Afflictions thou <hi>be not ſecure:</hi> think not with <hi>Agag, ſurely the bitterneſs of death is paſt;</hi> that now, thou haſt eſcaped this brunt, all is ſafe, and the danger paſt; ſtill be Watchful, and ſtand upon thy Guard. 1.

                  <p>But he gains this Loſs and Diſadvantage thereby, that thoſe Providences, that are not according to his deſire, gall him more by the Unquietneſs and Impatience of his mind under them.</p>

                     <hi>He that</hi> with an entire freeneſs of Soul <hi>ſubmits to the</hi> Divine Providences, gains thereby theſe <hi>Advantages;</hi> namely, 1. That certainly, ſuch a reſolved willing ſubmiſſion, never makes the Providences the more harſh or ſevere. 2. That commonly they are even in themſelves more gentle and eaſie, becauſe the Man needs not a ſeverity to bring him to a right temper of mind; namely, due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Divine Will. 3. But be the Providences never ſo harſh and hard, they
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152948:119"/>ſit more eaſie upon a quiet, patient, reſigning Soul.</p>
                  <p>A Man never loſeth by <hi>Prayer,</hi> for if the thing be <hi>Granted</hi> it makes the Bleſſing both the ſweeter and the ſafer, being the Humble Victory and Acqueſt of his Prayer: and it makes the Man the Better, the more Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for he looks upon it as a Gift, and not a Chance; the more Dependent upon God, and the readier upon all occaſions to call upon him, who hath honoured the Prayer of his Servant with a Conceſſion.</p>
                  <p>And if it be <hi>Denied,</hi> yet he loſeth not; for it may be the thing he asked might have done him harm, and been his prejudice. Again, though he be not gratified in the thing he deſired, a Thouſand to one but he is gratified, with what was fitter or better; But if not, yet the man receives infallibly this benefit by being denied, that he is made the better, the more Humble and Patient, and to be content that Almighty God ſhould be Maſter of his own Bounty, and not to be commanded by our Prayers. Or at leaſt it diſcovers unto him the Diſtemper of his Heart; if he be not contented to be denied, his Heart was Proud, and his Prayer Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical; he ſeemed to Pray, but indeed meant to Command, not to pray for what he deſired, which makes him thus Impatient of a denial.</p>

                     <hi>Senſe of Miſery,</hi> Want, or Danger, when we find no other means of Remedy or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, <hi>doth carry us to prayer,</hi> and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon God. The Sailors did this in the Storm. But commonly, though Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance follows even upon our very Prayers, <hi>we rarely</hi> with that ſeriouſneſs and intention of mind, <hi>return unto God the praiſe</hi> and Acknowledgment of his Goodneſs. Of the Ten Leapers that were cleanſed, we read only of One that returned Thanks for the Benefit; and commonly we either forget the Benefit, and our Benefactor, when our turn is ſerved, and are content to attribute our Deliverance to Chance, to Means, or to any thing, rather than to the Goodneſs of God. And the <hi>Reaſons</hi> may be theſe. 1. The Pride and Naughtineſs of our Hearts, that are unwilling to own our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, when we think we ſtand not in need of him. 2. Neceſſity, and Fear, and the Incumbent ſenſe of Evil are more preſſing and urgent, and by a kind of force oftentimes drive us to Pray, when we cannot probably find help elſewhere; But when the Neceſſity and Fear, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbence of Evil is removed, it is only a true Judgment, and the Grateful temper of our Hearts, that do ingage us to render Thanks for the Mercy received, which is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:152948:120"/>ordinarily more flat and leſs active than Evils felt or feared. Natural Neceſſity prompts a Man to Prayer oftentimes, but it is ſincerity and a right temper of the Soul that prompts a Man to Gratitude and Thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>He that in his Neceſſity prayes for Help and orbtains it, if his prayers were the fruit barely of his Exigence, is ſeldom Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and if he be not Thankful, it is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that his Prayers did not move from a Heart ſincere, and truly principled with a Dependence upon God, and a habit of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſs to him. But if he be Thankful for the Mercy received, it is an Evidence that not only his Gratitude, but his Prayers ſprang from the ſame Principle; namely, a Good and ſincere Heart, principled with the ſame habit of Grace, Piety, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, and Obedience to him.</p>
                  <p>There is an <hi>admirable Oeconomy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs and Wiſdom, to bring his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Man both to his Duty and Happineſs;</hi> many times he invites us to come to him by Perſwaſions, and Monitions, and <hi>ſecret Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and when we neglect that voice, he oftentimes ſends upon us <hi>Troubles,</hi> and Afflictions, and Dangers: and this he doth by a kind of moral force to make us flie to him by prayer for help, and relief, &amp; deliverance.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:152948:120"/>
                  <p>And it ſeldom miſſeth its effect, if there be but any Wiſdom or the Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct implanted generally in the Humane Nature. When we know not which way to turn, we then flie to God,
<note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.12.</note> becauſe all other ways are moſt commonly obſtructed and hedged up, and this paſſage only left open to an eſcape: <hi>In their Affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.15.</note> Almighty God deals by us, as a wiſe Artiſt, that hath a purpoſe to turn a ſtream towards ſome deſigned place, ſtops all other egreſſes but that which fits his deſign; or, as a Father, that is minded to bring an Extravagant Son to his Duty and Dependance, obſtructs all ſupplies but ſuch as may be had from himſelf. So oftentimes God Almighty doth ſo methodiſe his Afflictions, that all ways of relief are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, but ſuch as may lead a Man to him. It is true, many times in ſuch caſes we will be ſhifting and trying every avenue to get out at; but when we find every paſſage hedged up with Thorns, but that only which leads to him, our Stomachs come down, and we are glad to ſeek relief in that way where we find only it can be had. Like <hi>Jonas</hi> his Mariners in the Storm, we try all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Artifices to ſave our ſelves, throw out our Anchors, take down the Sails, ply
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:152948:121"/>the Pump, throw over the Goods to light<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en the Veſſel; and when all will not do, then we begin to call upon God, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet the method of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reſteth not here, but brings us a ſtep forward: He is often graciouſly pleaſed to grant the Deliverance we pray for, to let us ſee that we call not upon his Name in vain, and to incourage us to depend upon him, to draw near unto him, to make him our Confidence as well as our Fear: And though ſometimes he defers our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, yet he doth it, partly to give unto our ſelves an Experiment of our own Sincerity and Patience, partly to Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Tutor us to Conſtancy and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting upon him; partly to carry us on to more Importunity and Continuance in Prayer; and by this means our Souls are made the better by drawing nearer and nearer to him, that is the Fountain of Light and Goodneſs; for the repetition of Prayers rectifies the Soul, brings it nearer to God, lays more hold upon his Strength, and Goodneſs, as the ſinking Man draws himſelf nearer to the ſhore by the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laying hold upon that Cord that is from thence thrown out to ſave him.</p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:152948:121"/>
                  <p>Neither doth he reſt here, for the <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> he ſends, is not barely ſent to deliver us from the Affliction or Danger, nor barely to gratifie our Prayers; but to bring us yet nearer to God, and to make us active In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments <hi>to give Glory to that God,</hi> that hath thus delivered us; whereby at once we are drawn nearer to the Fountain of our own Happineſs, and Almighty God receives and attains the great end of his Goodneſs, in the active Glory and Gratitude that he receives from his Creature. And this is attained,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By a kind of Natural Inſtinct, Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and implanted Tendency, as I may call it, of a Good Nature; whereby, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Man be a fool, or hath put off the common Rudiments of Humanity, he is carried out to Thankfulneſs, Gratitude, and an indeavor of complacency to him that is his Benefactor; which, as it is the moſt rational conſequence imaginable, ſo it is a principle ſo riveted in the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Humanity it ſelf, that even without any antecedent ratiocination, or rational diſcourſe, it doth preſently, and at firſt view, and antecedently, antevert any rational diſcourſe of the Mind. We are Grateful, and ſtudy to be complacent to him that doth us good, without any
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152948:122"/>uſing of Topicks or Arguments, by a kind of Natural Inſtinct or Sympathy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By a kind of Stipulation or bargain made by Almighty God with his poor Creature, to have this Tribute of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Benevolent Affection from his Creature, as the Tribute and return of his Goodneſs and Beneficence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> And this Retribution, as it is moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Con-genious and Con-natural to the right conſtitution of the Humane Nature, ſo it is the moſt Reaſonable, and the moſt Noble, and the moſt Eaſie, and the moſt Beneficial Retribution in the World to him that makes it. For firſt, Whereas the Creature in his Prayer ſeeks, and in the returns thereof, receives ſomething from God, in his Gratitude, and Glorification of God he performs that, which his Maker graciouſly accepts, as a return made to him from his Creature. Secondly, By this means he attains the two great Ends of his Being; namely, the Glorifying of God, and the Improvement of his own Felicity; for Gratitude and Thankfulneſs brings the Soul to a nearer approach to God, if it be poſſible, than his very Prayers doth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the greateſt motion of Love and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152948:122"/>Beneficence in the Soul unto God that can be; and the nearer the Soul is moved unto God, the nearer it is joyned to its Life, its Perfection, its Happineſs: The more it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates of the Love, the Goodneſs, the Influence, the Communication of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prayer,</hi> Is always ſeaſonable in this life, becauſe we ever ſtand in need of it; we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways want ſomething, and have always occaſion to fear ſomething; although we could be ſuppoſed in ſuch a ſtate of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this World, that we could not ſay,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152948:124"/>we wanted any thing, yet we have cauſe to pray for the continuance of the Happineſs we injoy, which is not ſo fixed and ſtable, but that it may leave us: <hi>I ſaid in my proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I ſhall never be moved: Thou hiddest thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> We are never out of the reach of the Divine Providence, either to Relieve or Afflict us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are under a continual Neceſſity of Prayer, either to Relieve and Supply us, or, at leaſt, to preſerve and uphold us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> is likewiſe always ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe we are never without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that we receive from the Divine Goodneſs, that deſerves and requires our Thankfulneſs. It may be we want Wealth, yet have we not Health? If we want both, yet have we not Life? If we want Temporal Bleſſings, yet have we not Eternal Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Bleſſings? If we have any thing that is comfortable to, or convenient for us, we have it from the Goodneſs and Bounty of God. And though we have not all we would, yet we have what we deſerve not, and what we prize and value; and therefore while we have any thing, we have occaſion of Thankſgiving to our great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:152948:124"/>
                  <p>But yet it ſeems, though both thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be highly due and neceſſary, yet <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving hath a kind of preference even above Prayer</hi> it ſelf, in theſe conſiderations eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Duty of Thanksgiving ſeems to be a more <hi>Permanent</hi> Duty, even than Prayer it ſelf, <hi>and of a greater extent</hi> and durable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Bleſſed Angels, and the Saints that are and ſhall be ſettled and fixed in a ſtate of full and unchangeable Happineſs, that enjoy whatſoever they can deſire, and therefore have no reaſon to pray for more, becauſe they cannot enjoy more than they do; yet have an Everlaſting occaſion of Thanksgiving for that Happineſs they Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly enjoy: And as this is their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting occaſion, ſo it is and ſhall be their Everlaſting buſineſs unto all Eternity to Praiſe and Glorifie God. And as the Beams of the Divine Goodneſs ſhall Everlaſtingly ſhine upon them, ſo there will be an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reflection, as it were, of the ſame Goodneſs in the neceſſary and unceſſant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Praiſe and Thanksgiving by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Duty of Thanksgiving ſeems to be a Duty <hi>of more noble Nature,</hi> than even
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:152948:125"/>Prayer it ſelf, becauſe it <hi>anſwers</hi> more appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitly and cloſely <hi>the nobleſt End</hi> in the World; namely, the Glory of God, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a more ultimate and noble End, than even the very Good of the Creature. It is true, Almighty God receives no acceſſion to his Happineſs and Perfection by all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Praiſe and Thanksgiving that all the Creatures in the World can pay him, yet the Glory of his Majeſty is the chief ultimate End why he made all things, Rev. 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy to receive Glory, Honour, and Power; for thou haſt Created all things, and for thy pleaſure they were and are Created.</hi> It is true the proximate immediate reaſon of the Creation of all things was, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant Goodneſs of Almighty God might be communicated unto Being, derived from him by Creation: But the ultimate and more univerſal End was, that by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Divine Goodneſs unto ſomething without himſelf, the Glory, and Honour, and Praiſe thereof might return unto himſelf, who only can be the adequate End of himſelf, of all he doth. Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving therefore and Praiſe anſwers the greateſt and moſt noble End in the World: If I want, and pray for what I want, my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate End therein is my own Good, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152948:125"/>yet that End is too narrow, if I propound not to my ſelf to Praiſe and Glorifie the Bounty of that God which anſwers my Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, whereas all the Irrational and inanimate Creatures in the World do paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively praiſe Almighty God, in that they bear every one of them the Inſcription of his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power. The <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and Intellectual Natures</hi> of Men and Angels <hi>have that noble Advance,</hi> that they can and may <hi>Actively and Intentionally</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and Praiſe the Goodneſs of God: and it is indeed the nobleſt Harmony that they can make when they ſummon all their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Will, Affections, all that is within them, to Praiſe that God, to whom they owe their Being and Benefits: And the Wiſe and Glorious God doth therefore Communicate the ſenſible, Experimental, Eminent Influences of his Mercy, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bounty unto the Reaſonable and Intellectual Natures of Men and Angels, that they might touch and ſtrike upon thoſe noble ſtrings of the Heart and Mind and Affections, that may thereupon return the Harmony of Thanksgiving, and Praiſe to the great Lord of the World: And ſurely
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152948:126"/>the Nature of Man, in its true ſtate and temper, is as naturally and effectually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the returning of Thankſgiving to God for Mercies received, as a well tuned Lute, or other Inſtrument doth give an Harmonious ſound upon the touches of a skilful Artiſt. And moſt certainly that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſtrangely out of Tune and Order, that upon Mercies received makes not a ſweet return of Thankſgiving and Praiſe. This therefore, as it is the nobleſt, ſo it is the moſt natural production of the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Nature, the fulleſt of Congruity to the right diſpoſition of its Faculties.</p>
                  <p>Almighty God ſends upon the Children of Men Benefits, Bleſſings, Deliverances, Favours; And the fruit that he doth (and that moſt juſtly) expect, is a Crop of Praiſe, Glory, Honour and Thankſgiving, <hi>Call upon me in the day of Trouble, and I will Deliver thee, and thou ſhalt Glorifie me.</hi> And it is a barren, degenerate, ſtupid Heart, that yields not ſuch fruit of ſuch a Semination. So that Praiſe and Thankſgiving is Con-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to our very Faculties, the tribute that the Rational Nature, naturally payes to the Divine Being as his Benefactor, the very fruit that the great Lord of the Harveſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects for all his Goodneſs and Mercy.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:152948:126"/>
                  <p n="4">4. The truth is, Thankſgiving is <hi>the very End of Prayer:</hi> and as the End is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the means conducible to the End, ſo therefore is the Duty, the buſineſs of Thankſgiving in its ſelf, though equally neceſſary, yet more noble than Prayer it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I want ſomething that I would deſire Almighty God to give me, and I therefore pray; my Merciful Lord grants me my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and gives me what I pray for, and therefore gives it, and gives it upon my Prayer to him, that therefore his Mercy and Goodneſs may be more Evident unto me, and that thereupon I may Praiſe, and Glorifie, and give Thanks unto him.</p>
                  <p>And if, with the Nine Lepers in the Goſpel I receive the Benefit I ask, and do not with the Tenth give Glory to God for the Benefit I receive, I diſappoint both the Giver, of what he deſigned in the Gift, and diſappoint my very Prayers in that which is their juſt and proper End.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, that our Bleſſed Lord in that abſolute form of Prayer, which he hath taught us, premiſeth the firſt and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152948:127"/>greateſt Petition of the Hallowing or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the Name of God, and the firſt, the great, the regnant Petition, that is to influence all the reſt that follow, eſpecially thoſe that are for the ſupplies of our own wants.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whereas in Prayer we ask that we may receive from God, <hi>Almighty God</hi> hath been pleaſed to Honour and Dignifie our Duty of Thankſgiving, with ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention of his Majeſty, that he <hi>receives, or at least interprets it as a Receipt from his poor Creature.</hi> It is true, our Praiſes add nothing to his Perfection and ſelf-ſufficiency; Nay, our very Thankſgiving and Praiſe is but a gift that he gives to himſelf; He gives us a Being that may be Capable to Praiſe him, gives us Hearts and Affections that may be willing to Praiſe him, gives us Grace that may enable us to Praiſe him, gives us Benefits that may Excite us to Praiſe him, gives us Directions how to Praiſe him, gives us Laws, Commands, Promiſes, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Praiſe him: So that in truth our very Thankſgivings and Praiſes to him, are but his own work, and yet ſuch is his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he takes and accepts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Praiſes and Thankſgivings, as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:152948:127"/>if they were our own Actions. And whereas in Prayer we receive from him, in Thankſgiving he is pleaſed ſo far to Honour this Duty, as if he received ſomewhat from us, and accordingly accepts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>

                  <p>BY the <hi>Sin of Adam,</hi> and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Obliquity that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon entred into the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Mankind had contracted <hi>a three-fold miſchief.</hi> 1. <hi>Guilt,</hi> that needed an Expiation; 2. <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> that needed an Illumination; 3. <hi>Perverſeneſs and Rebellion,</hi> that needed Power and Victory to ſubdue it. In the fulneſs of time <hi>God ſent his Son</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:152948:130"/>into the World with healing for all theſe Diſeaſes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſent his Son <hi>to be our Sacrifice and our Prieſt:</hi> and not only ſo in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but by derivation unto thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, he hath imprinted upon them and communicated unto them a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Office, and hath made them Kings and Prieſts: 1. By making an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them with his Father, whereby they are accepted; <hi>John</hi> 16.26, 27. <hi>I ſay not unto you I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you:</hi> not to Exclude the continuance and Efficacy of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but to intimate the fulneſs of our Reconciliation, that having made us of his houſhold, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. we may have acceſs to the Maſter and Father of the Family; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>for through him we have acceſs unto the Father.</hi> 2. By ſending his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to inſtruct, and warm, and fit our ſpirits to come into the preſence; <hi>for through him we have acceſs by one Spirit, Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to ask, and inabling us to ask as we ſhould, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>For we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he made him a Sacrifice for our Guilt, ſo he ſent him <hi>to be a Light for our darkneſs,</hi> John 1.5. the World was all in Darkneſs and Error; the moſt Exact Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152948:130"/>Wits inſcribed their Altar, <hi>To the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God.</hi> They were ignorant of things to be known, and of things to be done. The Son of God that came out of the Boſome of his Father, and knew all his Mind, received a Commiſſion from him to inſtruct Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the way to Life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. <hi>I have given unto them the Words which thou gaveſt me.</hi> Joh. 3.34. <hi>He whom God hath ſent ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Words of God.</hi> Matth. 11.27. <hi>No man knoweth the will of the Father ſave the Son, and him to whom the Son revealeth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As he came with Light to inſtruct us, ſo he came with <hi>Power to conquer</hi> in us: <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power:</hi> and to conquer for us Death and Hell.</p>
                  <p>The Buſineſs that we are to conſider re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth principally the firſt and ſecond part of his Meditation, <hi>viz.</hi> in bringing the Will and Mind of God to us, to teach us what to ask, which concerns his Prophetical Office: And again, having formed deſires in us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Will of God, to preſent them unto his Father, which concerns his Prieſtly Office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After this manner pray:</hi> Luke 11.1, 2. <hi>One of his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, and he ſaid, When ye pray, ſay,</hi> &amp;c. In general we may learn:</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:152948:131"/>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt doth <hi>not exclude other Prayers:</hi> The injunction of this excludes not all other prayers. Our Saviour himſelf, and thoſe that were acquainted with his Mind and Practice, uſed variety of prayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral occaſions, differing from this form, and therefore the Apoſtle commands, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Praying always with all prayers and ſupplications.</hi> Prayers formed for every occaſion. And that Spirit, that maketh interceſſion for us with groans that cannot be uttered, is not confined to any particular form, not to vary from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though thou art not reſtrained to this form only, yet in all thy prayers pray <hi>after this manner.</hi> There is ſomewhat in this Prayer that muſt be ingredient to all thy prayers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be ſure thou haſt a Commiſſion, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for what thou prayeſt; deſire <hi>thoſe things that are warrantable</hi> by the Will of God revealed in his Word. Chriſt was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Mind of God, and gives us a pattern to ask thoſe things which are warrantable. Ask for thy good, but ask not for thy Luſt, <hi>James</hi> 4.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the things thou askeſt be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and agreeable to the revealed Will of God, Yet in <hi>the particularity of thy deſires</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:152948:131"/>refer thy ſelf and ſubmit unto the Will of God: becauſe thou art not wiſe enough to know what is fit for thee in particular, Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the meaſure, time, and manner of the thing thou askeſt. The Son of God hath taught us to pray for the fulfilling of the Will of God before the ſupply of our own Wants; and in his own Prayer in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Nevertheleſs not as I will but as thou wilt.</hi> Whatſoever thou deſireſt, yet confine not God. Thou ſhalt be ſure thy Prayer ſhall not loſe his fruit, though the thing deſired ſeem not to be granted. The Cup did not paſs from our Saviour, though he asked it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. Yet <hi>he was heard in that he feared,</hi> Heb. 5.7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As much as thou canſt <hi>let thy prayer be a reaſonable ſervice,</hi> a work of thy Spirit and Underſtanding. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. not only of thy Lips and Tongue: for thou haſt to do with the God of the Spirits of all fleſh, that will be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth. Pray with thy Lips, that thou mayſt by that means fix thy Mind the better to the work; but let thy words be the production of thy Soul. Let thy Heart pray as well as thy Tongue. And this was one of the Reaſons of our Saviour's inditing this Prayer in this ſhort and pithy form, to condemn the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152948:132"/>of the Gentiles, who had confidence in their vain repetitions of words, without the intention and application of the heart, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here we ſee Chriſt, the Wiſdom of the Father, delivers out <hi>a Form of Prayer,</hi> framed with a great deal of Wiſdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining very much matter in a few words: Learn that, though thou art not to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in ſtudied Devotions, nor to make thy prayers the work of thy invention or wit, but of thy Heart and Soul, yet let the Reverence and Awe thou beareſt to him, before whom thou comeſt in thy prayers, the ſeriouſneſs of the buſineſs about which thou goeſt, put thee in mind to <hi>Prepare thy ſelf and thy Soul,</hi> and to tune it by theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to an humble frame of ſpirit; to a fore-caſting of thy deſires; to an humble approach to the preſence of God; to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming Reverence both in thy words and geſture. The Heart, it is true, ſhould be in a continual frame of prayer, and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occurrence of our Life requires a lifting up of the Heart to God in Prayer, or in Thankſgiving; which cannot be ſo ordered with preparation; but a ſolemn Prayer, though in private, requires a juſt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart, and a performance of it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152948:132"/>with the whole contribution of the whole Soul, and ſtrength, and underſtanding, and affection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though thou art not bound to uſe no other form, yet <hi>uſe this frequently,</hi> upon theſe <hi>Conſiderations:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is <hi>the Command of thy Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> There is ſomewhat of Command in theſe words. He, that commands to pray, after this manner, meant not that this Prayer ſhould be forgotten. That which was made a pattern to thy other prayers, was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a thing only to be looked upon, and not to be uſed. Thou mayeſt uſe other Prayers to give ſcope to thy ſpirit, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a great <hi>means of ſtrengthning the Heart in Prayer.</hi> When I ſhall conſider I am now uſing that very Prayer which the Son of God, when he was in the fleſh, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his Diſciples, gave unto them, not only as a rule and pattern, but as a form, <hi>When ye pray, ſay,</hi> &amp;c. I call the great God my Father, and it is no preſumption in me ſo to do; the Eternal Son of God, that knew all his Father's mind, commanded me to call him ſo, and to come before him as my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am begging for the conveniencies of my Life, for the pardon of my Sins, for my preſervation in and from temptation.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152948:133"/>Had they not been things that I might hope to be granted, the Son of God would never have taught me to ask them.
<q rend="margQuotes">O Lord, it is true, I can ſee nothing in my ſelf why I ſhould expect that thou ſhouldeſt hear me; my Sins are renewed every day, and I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pardon but yeſterday, and I have ſinned againſt thee the ſame Sin this day: But yet thy Son, that knowes all thy Will, that would never have put me to beg that which were unfit for me to ask, or thee to grant, he it is that taught me to begg my daily bread of thee, and as often in the ſame Prayer to begg thy forgiveneſs: I will not learn hereby to preſume in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but yet I will learn to be confident in thy Mercy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is <hi>a Comprehenſive Prayer,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit to be ſupplemental unto thine own prayers. Thy preſent wants or fears or deſires carry thy ſpirit in thy own prayers eagerly and vehemently in purſuit of thoſe thy wants, fears, or deſires; becauſe they are things preſently incumbent upon thee, and in thy view; and by that means thou doſt many times in thy prayers overſhoot many matters, that are of more concernment, it may be, for thee to ask: as the Glory of God, thy preſervation from future inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that are not yet in thy view; and this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152948:133"/>prayer gathers up thy omiſſions, calls home thy ſpirit unto that frame and temper of heart that is fit; <hi>viz.</hi> Submiſſion to the Will and Glory of God in the firſt petition of this Prayer, furniſheth in a ſhort <hi>Compendium</hi> to pray over that which thou haſt before asked, and to pray for that which before thou haſt omitted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As it is a Comprehenſive Prayer, and contains much, ſo it is <hi>a Compendious Prayer,</hi> and contains much in little. The Wiſe and Merciful God knowes the frailty of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore hath fitted us according to our own narrowneſs with abridgments; he knowes the ſhortneſs of our Memory, and therefore he gave his Will under the Old Law in Ten Words. Chriſt he gave us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other abridgment of that abridgment: Love God and thy Neighbour. God alſo knowes the weakneſs of our ſpirits, and therefore he gives us a ſhort Prayer, that in the uſing of it our ſpirits may bear up, and the fire laſt till the Prayer ended. It is true, when we have a continuing ſenſe of Evil felt or feared upon us, our ſpirits are able to hold out a Prayer long in warmth and heat: But when the matters of our deſires are not ſo apparent to our ſenſe, our ſpirits are apt to grow cold before we come at the end of it. Here is a ſhort Prayer, furniſh'd in all things
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152948:134"/>fit to be asked, and ſuch as thy ſpirit may go along with to the End, without being tyred. It is true, that a Man ſhall uſually find more intention of ſpirit in his own prayers, than in this. Bleſs God that thou haſt this intention of ſpirit in thy own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and neglect them not, but pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that thou wanteſt it in this, and ſtrive to amend it.</p>
                  <p>Now the great <hi>Cauſe of the unprofitable uſe</hi> even of this Prayer, and of divers other Ordinances, grows from this, That people uſe them without a diſtinct and deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the things contained in them. The Sun in the Firmament is the greateſt Wonder in the World, and of infinite more conſideration than the appearance of a new Star or a Comet; But the commonneſs of the Sun makes Mankind paſs over that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any obſervation, and yet look upon the latter with much admiration and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Juſt thus it is with this and other Prayers: This Prayer, being taken up and learnt with our ſpeech, we ſwallow by whole-ſale, and never weigh it or conſider it; but other Prayers of our own or others, whileſt they are new to us, we uſe more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and it may be more profitably. It ſhould therefore be our care to rub out the Corn out of this Ear; to Examine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152948:134"/>this excellent Prayer diſtinctly, that ſo in the uſe of it a full underſtanding and affection may go along with it; without which it is no Prayer: for in Prayer we have to do with the God of the Spirits of all fleſh, that judgeth not, neither regardeth the bare repetition of words, the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by our Saviour when he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Prayer. But by the uniting our Souls and Spirits to him, our words are not ſo much our prayers, as the conſequents and ſigns of our prayers.</p>
                  <p>The known <hi>Diviſion of this Prayer,</hi> is firſt, the Preamble. Secondly, the Requeſts. Thirdly, the Concluſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Preamble, Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> The general duty we learn from it is this, that we come not ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly in our Requeſts to him, but as much as may be to prepare our Souls, with fitting apprehenſions and affections before we come to ask of him; with apprehenſions of his goodneſs, that may draw us to him in that he is our Father; and with apprehenſions of his Greatneſs, that may make us conſider our diſtance, and come before him with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in that he is in Heaven. Eccleſ. 5.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy Mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven and thou upon Earth: therefore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152948:135"/>let thy words be few.</hi> God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth: it teacheth thee thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and it is fit thou ſhould'ſt throughly digeſt that apprehenſion before thou ask, that thy asking may be with <hi>Reverence.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reverence of it ſelf is inconſiderable, but as it is the figure of that internal Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is in the Soul. Where the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reverence is without the internal, it is baſe and odious Hypocriſie, a dead and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed performance, a picture of Piety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life. But the internal Reverence of the Mind cannot be without an external expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. The Forms or Natures, that God hath put into every creature, are thoſe which ſhape their external figure, in ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anſwerable to their internal Form. And it is as impoſſible for an heart ſenſible of the Majeſty, Glory, Greatneſs and Power of God, to come before him either with a petulant ſawcy, preſumptuous or unſeemly carriage, as it is for the Form of a Lamb or a Child to render it ſelf either in the ſhape of a Lion, or a Wolf. Again, God is in Heaven and thou up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth: As thou haſt a buſineſs to do to prepare thy heart with the ſenſe of thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that thy deſires may be with a ſutable humility when thou prayeſt, ſo thou haſt need of preparation to bring up thy heart out of that Earth, wherein thou art, unto
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152948:135"/>Heaven, to defecate that Earthy heart of thine, that it may be fit to come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the God of Heaven. When God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the higheſt things in nature, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, he humbles himſelf, he deſcends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his own Excellency, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 113.6. And if thou art a Sutor to this great King, it is fit thou ſhouldeſt come unto the Throne of his Majeſty, and not expect that he ſhould come to thy Cottage to be importuned, though yet he doth this alſo in his great Mercy and Condeſcention; yet it is not fit for thee to expect it: Again, thy lifting up of thy heart to him is thy Advantage; the nearer thou draweſt to his Glory and Preſence, ſo it be with an humble and clean heart, the more thou wilt partake of his Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the fitter thy heart will be to have communion with him. The Holy and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels and Souls departed partake more of his fulneſs and perfection than Man doth, becauſe by the purity of their nature they have a nearer approach to the Fountain of Good, than Man hath; and the nearer or farther off the Spirit of a man comes or keeps off from God, the more or leſs of his Goodneſs he participates. Now in this act of prayer we endeavour to lay hold of his Goodneſs and Promiſes: Neceſſary it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we bring our hearts by preparation as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152948:136"/>near to him as we can. 1. That we may be near unto him; and in this nearneſs conſiſts an advantage of Communion with him. 2. That we may be like him; and that likeneſs is every day increaſed by our beholding of him, whereby we are in ſome meaſure tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the ſame Glory. 3. That we may be in our proper place. God hath commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated his goodneſs to all things according to their ſeveral degrees of perfection in thoſe ſtations, wherein his own Great and Infinite Wiſdom placed them, and the place of Man was nearer to God by his nature, than he can now arrive unto in this Life in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (though we have a High-Prieſt that continually bears our names before our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) And certainly, if it be at any time ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for a Man to wind up his heart in the greateſt nearneſs to God, that he can do, it is when he comes before him in Praiſes for the things he hath, and Petitions for the things he wants. Learn therefore in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to bring up thy heart as near as thou canſt to the great God in preparation and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before thou offereſt thy Prayer, that thy ſacrifice may be mingled with a true fire, and thy Soul may be raiſed up with the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what thou art about, and who thou art to deal withal.</p>

                        <hi>Our Father.</hi> Two things are herein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: 1. How God is ſaid to be our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: 2. What Frame or temper of heart and ſpirit this bleſſed relation and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, as a Father, ought to raiſe in us, eſpecially when we come before him in Prayer.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, God hath the appellation or relation of a <hi>Father</hi> principally <hi>in theſe reſpects:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>By Creation.</hi> Thus he is the Father of all things. But in as much as Paternity and Filiation are relations of perſons not of bare ſubſiſtency, properly, therefore in this reſpect he is called Father in relation to Angels and Men: to Men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.8. <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father, we are the clay, and thou our potter.</hi> Mal. 2.10. <hi>have not all one Father? hath not one God created us? Luke</hi> 3.38. <hi>which was the Son of Adam; which was the Son of God.</hi> And as to Men, ſo in a more near relation to the Souls of Men, and the bleſſed Angels, who participate more immediately of his Image and perfection, Jam. 1.17. <hi>The Father of lights.</hi> Heb. 12.9. <hi>The Father of Spirits.</hi> Zec. 12.2. <hi>The former of Spirits:</hi> Job 38.7. <hi>And all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>By ſpecial ſuſception,</hi> or undertaking, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without an intervenient Contract; thus he is pleaſed to own a more ſpecial Paternity towards thoſe that have moſt need of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.5. <hi>A Father of the Fatherleſs:</hi> or by an intervenient Contract; thus he was a Father in a more near Relation to the Jewiſh People, who as a Child is called by the Name of his Father, ſo they did as it were bear his Name, Jer. 14.9. <hi>We are called by thy Name, leave us not.</hi> Iſa. 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us;</hi> and accordingly he evidenced himſelf towards them in all the care and tenderneſs of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Deut. 32.11. <hi>As an Eagle fluttereth over her Young,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>and called my Son out of Egypt.</hi> But theſe Relations are yet too large and ſpacious.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>By Adoption in Chriſt.</hi> Which Relation is thus wrought, by an Eternal Stipulation between the Father and the Son; the Son was to take upon him our Nature by a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conception, and to ſtand as a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Mediator between the Father and lapſed Man, and appointed that as many as ſhould by true Faith lay hold on him, there ſhould be a kind of <hi>Union</hi> wrought between Chriſt and that Believer, and in that Union the Father looks upon all that which was in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152948:137"/>the Believer as imputed to Chriſt, and all that which was in Chriſt, as imputed to the Believer. Was there Sin and Guilt in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever? it is laid on Chriſt, and he bears all Iniquities, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. Is there Righteouſneſs in Chriſt? the Believer hath that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> Is Chriſt the Firſt-born of God? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 89.25, 26. Though we cannot partake of his Primogeniture, yet we partake of his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. John 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God.</hi> John 20.17. <hi>I aſcend unto my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and to your God.</hi> Gal. 4.5. <hi>That we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> And by vertue of this Union we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the inheritance of Sons, <hi>Joynt-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 4.7. of the Spirit of Sons. Gal. 4.6. <hi>And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,</hi> &amp;c. And by vertue of this Filiation we have the Priviledges of Sons; <hi>Acceſs with boldneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father,</hi> Epheſ. 2.19. Care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of our Father over us. Matth. 6.32. <hi>For your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things:</hi> Audience from him, John 16.26. <hi>At that day ye ſhall ask in my Name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> Now this Appellation and Relation of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the firſt Entrance into Prayers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152948:138"/>up our hearts unto theſe <hi>Conſiderations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That we ſhould by all means labour to be in this relation to God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould be our Father; for why do we call him ſo, unleſs he be ſo to us? and that we ſhould not be contented barely with the Relation unto him as we are Men; for ſo were even the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who inſcribed their Altar, <hi>To the Unknown God,</hi> His Off-ſpring, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. nor with the Relation ariſing out of an external Profeſſion and Covenant, but with that neareſt Relation of Paternity, ariſing by our Union with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And conſequently that all our Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God in Prayer muſt be in, and through Chriſt, for through him is this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wrought; and it is a Relation of Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Union, which is the greateſt Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Epheſ. 2.13. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye, who ſometimes were a far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt;</hi> and 19. <hi>of the Houſe-hold of God:</hi> our Union unto God growes by our Union to Chriſt, who is one with the Father, John 17.23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one,</hi> and this is the meaning of asking in his Name, <hi>John</hi> 16.26. through him we have an acceſs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We learn <hi>with what Affections</hi> we ſhould come to him in our Prayers. And theſe ariſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152948:138"/>either from the conſideration of our duty, as Children; or from the conſideration of that which we are to expect from him, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thoſe of the firſt part are principally theſe, Love, Reverence, Submiſſion, and Thankfulneſs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Love to God.</hi> The very name of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imports in it ſelf a relation of benefit, and conſequently of Love. God is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thy being, as thou art a Man, and of thy continual preſervation; and if there were no more than this in this comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive name of Father, it is enough to take up the whole ſtock and compaſs of thy Love. The Motion from not being to being, is an infinite Motion, and an act of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as of infinite Power, and deſerves and challengeth the uttermoſt extent of thy Love, as a juſt debt unto it; ſo that thou haſt ſcarce a reſidue of love left within the compaſs of thy uttermoſt power, which thou oweſt not to this great Love of thy Lord in giving thee a being; &amp; if this common Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy Lord requireth and deſerveth all thy Love to him as the Father of thy nature, what Love doſt thou owe him as he is pleaſed to be thy Father in a nearer relation? to be thy Father in Chriſt? and that after thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt rejected him and wert Loſt? and if thy debt of Love, that thou oweſt to him as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152948:139"/>of thy Nature, be more large than the Comprehenſion of thy Power, how, or with what wilt thou pay that further debt of Love, which thou oweſt to him for that undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unſought for, ſuperadded relation of thy Father by Adoption? when he gave his own Son to dye for thee, an enemy, that thou mighteſt receive the Adoption of a Son? This is a love that paſſeth not only thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, but alſo thy knowledge. <hi>Behold, what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God,</hi> 1 John 3.1. And the Love of God to us, as it is the meritorious Cauſe of our Love to him, ſo it is that which Excites and fires our Love to him, 1 John 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> And according to the meaſure we have of the apprehenſion of the Love of God to us, according is the meaſure of our Love to him again. This therefore is the firſt affection that the name of Father calls out, <hi>viz.</hi> The intenſeſt affection of our Love, in that he hath given us a Commiſſion to call him Father, and Chriſt is not aſhamed to call us Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Reverence;</hi> and this is but a conſequent of the former. <hi>Perfect Love caſts out fear,</hi> 1 John 4.18. But it is the Mother of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>We have had Fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152948:139"/>reverence,</hi> &amp;c. Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I be a Father, where is my honour?</hi> were there no other diſtance of nature between thy God and thee, but the diſtance and relation of a Father, it requires Reverence of thee, eſpecially when thou comeſt before him in thy Prayers. And that inward Reverence of thy Soul will imprint a Reverence in thy Words, and in thy Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; as all other Affections and Tempers of the Soul fix a ſutable correſpondence upon the outward Man, but eſpecially when we conſider he is our heavenly Father.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Submiſſion to his Will.</hi> Conſider thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is to thy Father, which carries with it a relation of Authority, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he is a Father of Wiſdom, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is fitteſt for thee, and a Father of Mercies, that is oftentimes more merciful to thee in denying thee what thou askeſt, than he could be in granting it: it is thy duty to ask what thou wanteſt, becauſe he is thy Father; but not to limit him what he ſhould grant.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> for all thou haſt received; becauſe as he is the Author of thy Being, ſo he is the Fountain of all thy Benefit.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And as the Name of Father carries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theſe Affections of Love, Fear, Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Thankfulneſs towards God, ſo it brings down thoſe <hi>Apprehenſions of God,</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:152948:140"/>that are <hi>ſuitable to the buſineſs</hi> about which we are.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the conſideration that God is our Father thus placed in the Entrance of this Prayer, we have <hi>Incouragement to make our acceſs</hi> unto him with an humble boldneſs. When we conſider the Glory, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the Purity of the Great and Infinite God, in whoſe ſight the Heavens are not clean, nor the Stars pure, <hi>Job</hi> 15.15. &amp; 25.5. that chargeth his Angels with folly, and in his Preſence the Cherubins cover their faces: How ſhould duſt and Aſhes, Man that is a Worm, under the apprehenſion of his Majeſty and Glory, ever think that this Glorious God ſhould liſten unto, or entertain his Perſon or his Prayers? When <hi>David</hi> conſidered but of the Sun and Moon and Starrs, which are but the works of his hands, he found a great diſproportion between us and them. <hi>What is Man that thou ſhouldſt be mindful of him? Pſal.</hi> 8.4. Much more between us and their and our Creator; the Son of God therefore, that knew his Fathers Will, and the thoughts he beareth towards us, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him to us in the brink of our Prayers under the Expreſſion of a Father, that might invite us, before he renders him under the apprehenſion of his being in Heaven, that might Eſtrange us; under the conception of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152948:140"/>the Love and tenderneſs of a Father, before conception of his Majeſty and Glory. And is he thy Father? why ſhouldeſt thou not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions reſort unto him? whither ſhould a Child go with boldneſs, if not to his Father? and to ſuch a Father as he is pleaſed to render himſelf unto us, with more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and gentleneſs than lyes within the bowels of a natural Father? Iſa. 49.15. <hi>Can a woman;</hi> whoſe affections are moſt ardent and importunate, <hi>forget her Child,</hi> a piece of her ſelf, <hi>her ſucking Child,</hi> to whom ſhe is ingaged by an additional obligation of Love and Care, <hi>that ſhe ſhould not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi> when her natural Love is heightned by a pityfull accurance, <hi>of the Son of her Womb,</hi> the perfection of her conception? <hi>Yea, ſhe may forget yet I will not forget thee, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? my Heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the fierceneſs of mine anger; for I am God and not Man,</hi> Hoſ. 11.3. <hi>I taught</hi> Ephraim <hi>to go, leading him by the hand; Ephraim</hi> like a weak Child was ready to ſtumble &amp; fall upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion, and like a froward Child apt to ſnatch away his hand from him that led him; yet the affection of a Father is not loſt by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152948:141"/>weakneſs or frowardneſs of a Child, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6, 11. <hi>Do you thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh People and unwiſe? Is not he thy Father that bought thee? As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt and fluttereth over her Young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings taketh them and beareth them on her wings, ſo the Lord alone did lead him.</hi> And all theſe, and a world of the like Expreſſions in the Book of God, to unvail the love of God to his Creatures, and thereby to draw out an aweful love to him, and an humble boldneſs to make an approach unto him, Heb. 4.16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace;</hi> and to bleſs our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who by the price of his Blood hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed this free liberty of acceſs unto God as our Father. Epheſ. 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence.</hi> Who as he hath purchaſed acceſs for us, ſo when, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that we are fearful, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and aſhamed to come, is pleaſed in the virtue of his own Mediation to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Glory and Brightneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and us poor Creatures, and to ſhew us more of his Goodneſs and Mercy than of his Glory; and to receive our deſires, and to bring both them and us into the preſence of his Father, and our Father.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As this Expreſſion leads us unto God, and gives us acceſs, ſo it gives us <hi>aſſurance of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152948:141"/>ſucceſs</hi> in our Petitions. This Prayer as is ſaid, is a comprehenſive Prayer; we thereby in an Abridgement ask whatſoever is neceſſary for this life or that to come, but the Name of a Father is a comprehenſive Name; the Petitions that thou art asking are large Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and the Promiſe is yet more large, <hi>John</hi> 16.23. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my Name he will give it you.</hi> Matth. 7.7. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you:</hi> But here is the Foundation, thy application is to thy Father: Matth. 7.11. <hi>If ye being evil know how to give good things to your Children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him.</hi> Whatſoever thou canſt find or expect from thy Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo much, and much more, may'ſt thou expect from thy Heavenly Father: Patience, to bear with thy infirmities and failings, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 78.18. Compaſſion, to pity thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. Goodneſs, to ſupply thy wants; Juſtice, to avenge thy injuries; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.14. Protection, to defend thee from dangers; Vigilancy and care, to ſupport thee againſt Temptations; Mercy to pardon thy back-ſlidings; <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14. Skill, to interpret, and Tenderneſs to accept thy weak and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Petitions; Providence and Bounty, abundantly to reward all thy ſincere perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Luk. 12.32. <hi>Fear not little flock, it is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152948:142"/>my Fathers good will to give you a Kingdome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this Conſideration of God, as our Father, when we come before him in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as it teacheth us our duty, ſo it doth moſt naturally teach us the three firſt Petitions to deſire the Glory of his Name, the Increaſe of the manifeſtation of his Kingdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the full ſubmiſſion unto, and deſire of the fulfilling of his Will. And as that relation looks downward upon us, ſo it concludes the three laſt Petitions. From whom ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou deſire or expect Mercy to forgive thee, Conveniencies to ſupply thee, Care and Protection to preſerve and deliver thee from Evil, if not from a Father? and as from this appellation of a Father we gather <hi>Confidence in his love,</hi> ſo in the next qualification or deſcription of this Father we gather <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Which art in Heaven,</hi> or Heavenly Father, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.26. To denote 1. The eminence of his Glory and Power. The Heavens are the moſt Eminent and Glorious Creatures that our Eyes behold, and ſpeak much of the Glory and Majeſty of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. and in this adjunct of Heavenly, we give him the acknowledgement and attribution of the Greatneſs of his Power and Glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. <hi>For our God is in the Heavens, and he hath done whatſoever he pleaſeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:152948:142"/>
                     <p n="2">2. Heaven the Throne of his Majeſty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. <hi>The Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Foot-ſtool.</hi> Pſal. 68.4. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol him that rideth upon the Heavens.</hi> Deut. 33.26. <hi>who rideth upon the Heavens for thy help, and in his excellency upon the sky.</hi> 1 Kings 8.49. <hi>Heaven thy dwelling place.</hi> Which though it be the Seat of his glory, yet it is not the circumſcription of his Preſence. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27. <hi>The Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee.</hi> Pſal. 113.4. <hi>his Glory is above the Heavens.</hi> Iſa. 57.15. <hi>The high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible infinitude.</hi> Pſal. 139.8. <hi>If I aſcend into Heaven, thou art there; and if I make my bed in Hell, thou art there.</hi> Iſa. 40.22. <hi>It is he that ſitteth on the Circle of the Earth.</hi> So that his Preſence is in all places; and though, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Creatures, the greateſt manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Preſence is above the Heaven, yet his Infinite and Eſſential Glory is equally in all places. Now from this attribution <hi>we learn,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Duty in Prayer.</hi> As a Chriſtian ſhould always have his Converſation in Heaven, from whenee he expects his Saviour, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. ſo in a ſpecial manner when he comes to God in Prayer. Hence Prayer is called a drawing near to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. lifting up the Heart unto God. Know therefore thou do'ſt, or at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152948:143"/>leaſt, ſhouldeſt, in Prayer bring thy Heart up into Heaven before the Throne of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty; which imports or inforceth theſe <hi>Conſequents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Let thy Spirit be mingled with thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> for there is no other way to draw near to God, but by bringing thy ſpirit into his preſence. He is a Spirit, and will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Spirit; thy Body is here upon the Earth, and thy words vaniſh before they are gone far from thee. Thou canſt not get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preſence of the Lord of Heaven, but with thy Spirit and Soul; and unleſs thy Prayer be the drawing near of thy Spirit to him, thy Prayer is a Provocation, and not a Service; unprofitable and uſeleſs for thee, and unaccepted and not regarded by God; it dyes, and is rotten in the Earth, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come up to thy Father, which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Let thy Spirit</hi> be a pure Spirit, <hi>and thy Prayers</hi> be pure Prayers; for what hath any thing that is impure to do with Heaven, a place of Purity and Holineſs! None, but the <hi>pure in ſpirit can ſee God,</hi> Matth. 5.8. and none but <hi>pure hands are fit to be lifted up to him,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. Pſal. 24.4. And that thy Spirit may be pure, and fit to come up into this High and Holy Place, and to have Communion with the Holy and Glorious

The Prieſts under the Law, when they were to come near unto God in their Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were to be waſhed and clean from their natural and external Impurities; and a Leper was not ſuffered to come into the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but what is that to the Leproſie and Impurity of thy Spirit, that very part of thee that only can have an immediate acceſs to God? and what Communion can there be between an holy God and an unholy Soul? Pſal. 66.18. <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, God will not hear me.</hi> Conſider therefore that thy approach is unto Heaven, the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place of his Majeſty, and of his Glory, and Holineſs becomes ſuch an Habitation.

Behold he putteth no truſt in his Saints, yea the Heavens are not clean in his ſight, how much more abominable and filthy is Man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</hi> Job 15.14, 15, 16. But for this, thy Saviour hath given thee an Expedient; he taketh away the iniquity of thy Holy things, and mingles thy Sacrifice with his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and covers thy impurities with his own righteouſneſs, and if for all this the cenſe of thy own vileneſs cover thy Heart with ſhame, and the burden of thy Sins and Corruptions keeps thy Soul under, that it cannot with that clearneſs and confidence look up unto Heaven, but, with the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can in the Goſpel, ſtand afarr off, and ſcarce dareſt ask for any thing, but what the ſenſe of Guilt inforceth, <hi>viz.</hi> Mercy to pardon thee; yet ſuch is the Goodneſs of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to thy low and humbled Soul, that though thou haſt ſcarce confidence enough to draw nigh unto God, yet he hath compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enough to draw nigh unto thee. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken Heart.</hi> And though thy laden Soul can ſcarce get up into Heaven, into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thy Creator, yet he will bring down

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Let thy Prayer be full of Reverence with thy whole Man:</hi> for as thou comeſt to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in that relation thou oweſt him Reverence, ſo thou comeſt to a Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the great Lord and Judge of all things. 1 Pet. 1.17. <hi>And if ye call on the Father, who without reſpect of perſons judgeth according to every man's works, paſs the time of your ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in fear.</hi> And as a Father, and ſuch a Father calls for thy Reverence, ſo eſpecially when thou conſidereſt that thou comeſt to this great King in his Throne, in the place of his Majeſty and Glory. And therefore this Expreſſion is added, to take up the whole Latitude of thy thoughts, with the higheſt apprehenſions of the Glory and Majeſty of the Lord, before whom thou comeſt; and that thou maiſt conſider the Infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that is between thee and the Lord of Heaven; Iſa. 55.9. <hi>For as the Heaven is higher than the Earth, ſo are my thoughts than your thoughts, and my ways than your ways.</hi> And upon this conſideration to admire and

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Let thy Prayers be full of Intention:</hi> Thou doſt, or ſhouldeſt, bring up thy Soul into Heaven, into the Preſence of the Great and Glorious God; and what ſhould thy wandring thoughts, thy Earthly buſineſs do there? leave them at the foot of the Hill, when thou aſcendeſt into the Mount of God. Conſider, the perſon, to whom thou comeſt, exactly views and obſerves the frame, and connexion, and workings, and motions of thy thoughts and deſires, and whether they go along with thy words, or with thy External deportment: and if they do not, ſo much of thy Prayer is not only loſt, but a mockery and abuſe of thy Maker. And as the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Perſon to whom thou makeſt thy addreſs, ſo the Place where thou comeſt doth not ſute with thoſe impertinent and vain diverſions. Therefore when thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt do it conſiderately, adviſedly, and with the whole Intention of thy Soul. Eccleſ. 5.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart utter any thing haſtily before God, for God is in Heaven and thou upon Earth.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. Hence learn <hi>the All-ſeeing Eye of God,</hi> that is acquainted with all thy wants, and with all thy deſires. It was a miſtaken uſe that was made of his being in Heaven, Job 22.14. <hi>Thick Clouds are a covering to him that he ſeeth not, and he walketh in the circuit of Heaven.</hi> No, but Pſalm 33.13. <hi>The Lord looketh from Heaven, he beholdeth all the Sons of Men. Pſal.</hi> 11.4. The diſtance of the place is no diſadvantage to his ſight or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Again, Though Heaven be the Seat of his Glory, yet all places are filled with his Preſence; but eſpecially <hi>he is nigh to them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth,</hi> Pſal. 145.18. <hi>is nigh to ſuch as be of a broken Heart,</hi> Pſalm 34.18. <hi>is round about his people,</hi> Pſal. 125.2. <hi>is nigh unto them in all they call upon him for,</hi> Deut. 4.7. <hi>will bow down his Ear to hear,</hi> Pſal. 31.2. <hi>will bow the Heavens and come down</hi> for their good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.9. So that thy Prayers have no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to go, for all places are Heaven where God is, and he is in all places, eſpecially where two or three are gathered together in his Name to call upon him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence learn the <hi>All-ſufficient and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of God,</hi> Pſal. 115.3. <hi>Our God is in Heaven, he hath done whatſoever he pleaſed.</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:152948:146"/>As the relation of a Father carrieth with it a fulneſs of love, to be willing to grant thy largeſt requeſts, ſo the Conſideration that he is a Heavenly Father carrieth with it a fulneſs of Power to grant them. Theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of the Love and Power of God bear up the Heart in Prayer, as once <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi> hands, <hi>Exodus</hi> 17.12. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are both placed in the Porch of this Prayer, like the pillars of <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.21. To ſtabliſh and ſtrengthen thy Heart in thy Prayer to God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As the conſideration of Heavenly, or <hi>which art in Heaven,</hi> carries thy Heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his Power and All-ſufficiency to grant thy Petitions, ſo it improves thy Faith in <hi>his Infinite Tenderneſs and Goodneſs.</hi> When thou comeſt to the Father of thy fleſh, thy Earthly Father, that relation imports and carries with it, much love and compaſſion, as hath been obſerved; but though he be thy Father, yet he is an Earthly Father; and as his Power and Sufficiencies are narrow and weak, and not adequate to the Extent of thy wants and deſires, ſo his Affections are limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mingled with the paſſions and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of his Temper or Age. A Woman may forget the Son of her Womb, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. And the hands of the pitiful Woman may ſeeth her own Children, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.10.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152948:146"/>And Fathers are apt to provoke their own Children. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. But were there not mixtures of Diſtempers in the affections of Parents, yet their affections are finite, &amp; ſuch is our condition, that in one day we ſhould out-ſin all that ſtock of Patience to bear, and mercy to forgive, that the moſt tender earthly Father ever had or could be capable of. We ſtand in need every day of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite bowels of a Heavenly Father, to bear and pardon and receive us, as of infinite Power to ſupply and ſupport us. Iſay. 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his wayes, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and be will have Mercy, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon, for my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your wayes my wayes, ſaith the Lord; for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my wayes higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi> Hoſ. 13.9. <hi>Oh Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help. I will not return to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> Ephraim, <hi>for I am God and not Man, Hoſ.</hi> 11.9. As if he ſhould have ſaid, Were all the Compaſſions, and Bowels, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Tenderneſs in the World combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one Man, yet thy Sins are grown to that height, and thy provocation to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that all that Patience were too weak to bear, and all that compaſſion too ſmall to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152948:147"/>pardon thee; thou haſt out-ſinned all the Compaſs and extent of a created Patience, but I am God, and not Man, I have Patience enough for all this to bear with thee; and Mercy enough abundantly to Pardon thee. Jer. 3.12. <hi>Return thou back-ſliding</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever; Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt the Lord thy God.</hi> The Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of God runneth through all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and is no leſs ſeen in his Mercy to pardon, than in his Power to create. Numb. 14.17, 18. <hi>And now, I beſeech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, ſaying, the Lord is long-ſuffering and of great Mercy.</hi>

That they may have upon them that Beauty, Comlineſs and Uſefulneſs, that he originally did put upon them. God made all things for his Glory, and in conformity thereunto they were in their original full of Beauty and Order; and the Excellence of the Work did ſpeak the Perfection of the Workman; but the Sin of Men and Angels brought upon ſome parts of his works a deformity and diſorder. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. <hi>I have curſed the ground for thy ſake.</hi> And though in that curſe, and in all other the conſequents of Sin, there is ſtill a Glory of the Juſtice of God in puniſhing, and of his Wiſdom in managing of them; yet much of the beauty of the works themſelves is taken from them by that diſorder that ſin hath brought upon them.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152948:151"/>impreſſion of his Glory; that they may have a conformity, not only to his will, but to his good pleaſure; that in all things the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Goodneſs, and Power of God may be conſpicuous; that he would in Chriſt take out that diſorder and curſe, that hath by Sin defaced the Creature; that all things may in the higheſt meaſure be reſtored to their primitive perfection; that all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currencies of the World, and all the actions of Men and Angels, may carry in them the moſt eminent inſcription of his Preſence, Wiſdome and Goodneſs, and may be directed with the beſt advantage to his Glory. Our love to God makes that, which he wills, to be our wills; and as he wills his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo it makes us to deſire his Glory; And though we are to leave the particular mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation thereof to his Wiſdome, yet it muſt be our chief deſire that all things may, in the higheſt meaſure, move to his Honour, and bear the inſcription of it.

That the obſervation and diſcovery of the Truth and Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of God, may not only work a conviction thereof in our Underſtandings and Judgments (for thus it doth even to the devils themſelves) but that that conviction may raiſe up <hi>in the minds and affections</hi> thoſe <hi>ſutable conſequences,</hi> that ſhould ariſe from ſuch a conviction, ſuch as are theſe: 1 A <hi>ſubſcription and ſetting to our ſeal</hi> that God is True, and Juſt, and Merciful. In the work of Conviction we are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner paſſive, but herein we are active, when in our hearts we do cheerfully and willingly ſubſcribe and atteſt to all that Goodneſs and Truth, whereof we are thus convinced. 2 An <hi>Inward Admiration</hi> of the Power, Truth and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152948:152"/>Glory of God, that is thus diſcovered unto us. The natural effect of great diſcoveries is Admiration. 2 Theſ. 1.10. <hi>To be admired in all them that believe.</hi> 3 <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of that goodneſs of his, not only that is diſcovered unto us, but that ſo far condeſcends to his creature, as to ſhew us ſo much of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Truth and Greatneſs. 4 An <hi>Attribution of Infinitely more</hi> Glory, Majeſty, Mercy, Goodneſs, and all Perfection unto him, than poſſibly I can diſcover by any of theſe Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations, conſidering that all his Works put together cannot ſpeak his Fulneſs. If I could ſee all the Glory of God, that all the Works of God in the whole World do bear upon them, yet I muſt needs conclude in reaſon, that they are infinitely ſhort of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he hath in him: for he muſt needs have a reſidue of Power and Wiſdom, infinitely more than commenſurate to all his Works put together: but alas! I ſee but a part of his Works, and ſo narrow is my capacity, that I find plainly I cannot reach to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of any Work, nor ſearch it out, nor his Power, Wiſdom and Glory that lyes in a fly or worm, to the uttermoſt; and yet I ſee ſo much as doth aſtoniſh me, and confound me, even in the leaſt of all his Workings; what meaſure then muſt his own Fulneſs amount unto? and this made <hi>David,</hi> and the other Saints
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152948:153"/>of God, whoſe Eyes he had opened, even to loſe themſelves in the Contemplations and Expreſſions of the Goodneſs and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. 5. <hi>Areturn of infinite Fear and Reverence, Love, Dependance, Submiſſion, and Obedience,</hi> and of all the choiceſt and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motions of our Souls to him, as the juſt deſert of his Goodneſs and Truth, and the juſt Tribute due to his Majeſty and Glory. And this is the Sanctifying of the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17. And thus he will be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by all them that draw near unto him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. The Sanctifying of the Lord in the heart, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And as theſe affections and motions are made in the heart, ſo by all <hi>External Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of the tongue, to evidence that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conviction and affection of the Soul; and, as much as in us lyes, to propagate and proclaim to all the World the Glory due to God, by acknowledging openly his Truth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.39. When the people ſaw the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the fire devouring the water, they fell on their faces, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord he is God, the Lord he is God.</hi> By aſcribing Greatneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.

Magnifying his works; <hi>Job</hi> 36.24. by inviting and exciting all the Creatures in the World, according to their uttermoſt activity, to praiſe his Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.5. Out of the abundance of the Heart, thus poſſeſſed with the ſenſe of the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, the mouth will ſpeak.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That from the ſame Principle in the heart, <hi>the lives of Men and Angels</hi> may bring Glory and Honour to God; that is, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of their Natures and lives to the will of God concerning them. Other Creatures, by a paſſive Conformity unto the Will of God, bring Glory unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> by moving as they are moved by thoſe natural Inſtincts that are put in them; but to Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels God hath given that Honour to have in them an active Principle, not only to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but to conform to the Will of God, and to bring Glory to his Name: and when by our ſin and contracted Corruption Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath diſabled himſelf to exerciſe that power, which God once gave him to glorifie his Creator, Chriſt came to reſtore him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſuch a condition, that he might actively bring Glory to God by an active Conformity to the Mind and Will of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. For this Cauſe <hi>he died, that they which live ſhould not live to themſelves but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that died for them.</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>ad idem.</hi>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:152948:154"/>And this was a principal part of that <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> that he wrought, <hi>viz.</hi> as for the things that were paſt, reconciling God to Man by Forgiveneſs and Pardon, ſo for the time to come reconciling Man to God by Conformity to Him and his Will. Sin made an unlikeneſs of Man to God, and thereby deſtroyed the Image of God in Man; for an Image conſiſts in the likeneſs of another thing. Chriſt came to reſtore that Image again; <hi>Coloſ,</hi> 3.10. And that not to reſt meerly in the internal Diſpoſitions of the Soul, but that, as he that hath called us is holy, we ſhould be holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. Which is impoſſible to be ſevered, ſo that the former ſhould be without the Latter; for, as <hi>out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaks,</hi> ſo out of the ſame abundance the hand worketh; and the ſanctification of the Mind can as ill be contained within the Heart without ſome Expreſſion in the Life, as any other temper or diſpoſition of the Mind can be reſtrained from diſcovering it ſelf. That Communion, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had with God in the Mount, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed a Glory on his Face; and that Image of God, the conformity of the Heart unto him, will ſhine through into the Life; and that out of a double Principle: 1. As a conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequence of the inward diſpoſition.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152948:154"/>2. Out of the Love and Obedience to God, Matth. 5.16. <hi>That men may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> So that when I pray that the Name of God may be Sanctified, I do deſire that God would in Chriſt re-imprint his Image upon Man, that he would renew him in the Spirit of his Mind, and reſtore him to a Conformity unto his Divine Will, which is our Sanctification; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. And that the outward Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Men may be ſutable to this inward Conformity, in all Obedience to the good pleaſure of God; that as they profeſs his Name, ſo they may appear to be his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Epheſ. 2.10. <hi>And walk worthy of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.12. <hi>That others beholding their good works may glorifie God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.12.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Oppoſites to this Petition,</hi> is, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and Curſing the Name of God (for to that heighth of vill any the corruption of Nature hath riſen) That that fearful and terrible Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58. hath not eſcaped the blaſphemous Tongues of Men, deſpiſing his Majeſty. Job 21.15. <hi>What is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> Exod. 5.2. <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice?</hi> Taking his Name in vain, uſing of it lightly or irreverently; It is a terrible Name,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152948:155"/>and not to be uſed without ſummoning up of all the awe and reverence of our hearts: or falſly, either in ſolemn oaths, ſwearing falſly by his Name; or pretending meſſages from him that he never ſent. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14. Propheſying Lyes in his Name, whereby a diſhonour is brought upon his Truth: Pride, Arrogancie and Self-admiration, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the Glory due unto God, and uſurp that which is only due unto him, and moſt dear to him. Iſa. 48.11. <hi>My Glory will not I give to another.</hi> Therefore God doth in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner hate, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Pro.</hi> 9.13. and reſiſt it, and them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. when <hi>Herod</hi> intercepted the Glory of the People, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained it, and gave not God the Glory, the Angel of the Lord ſmote him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. and when the great King was puffed up with the greatneſs of his Glory and Power, then the Meſſage comes that the Kingdom is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.13. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly God takes that ſeaſon to puniſh the whole ſtock of Sins, that a man hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when his heart is moſt lifted up: <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction.</hi> Again, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sins, theſe bid defiance to the Name of God, to his Truth, his Juſtice, his Power, his Preſence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.20. The Jealouſie of God will ſmoke againſt ſuch a Man: Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sins in thoſe that bear or profeſs the

This Inadvertence partly diſappointeth God of his End, and robbeth him of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Miſapplication of events either to falſe cauſes, Idols, Fate, Fortune, or only to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, without the due attribution of all to the moſt Wiſe and Powerful Counſel of the Mighty Lord, Deut. 8.17, 18. <hi>And thou ſay in thy Heart, my power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth; but thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is hee that giveth thee power to get Wealth;</hi> So for promotion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152948:156"/>Bleſſings acknowledge his Mercy, and labour to find him in them; in all thy Afflictions acknowledge his Juſtice and his Wiſdom; Labour to find out the Cauſe, and give him the Glory.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning <hi>the Order of this Petition;</hi> it fell not <hi>in the firſt place</hi> by Chance; but he that was the Wiſdom of the Father placed it there upon moſt juſt <hi>Reaſons:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Glory of God</hi> is that which is firſt to be ſought for; becauſe it is the chief End of God in all things, and that which he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended. He made all things for his Glory.
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vide</hi> Iſa. 43.7, 21.</note> The firſt and higheſt Duty of Man is to Love God, and Love to God will carry the Heart to deſire that firſt, which God firſt wills; in ſo much as if the Glory of God muſt be loſt, or the Soul that loves him, the perfection of Love will chooſe the preſervation of his Glory, rather than of it ſelf, if it were poſſible. <hi>Vide Exod.</hi> 32.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is the Juſteſt, and only Tribute that all Creatures can return to God for their Being and Bleſſing. Such is his infinite Self-ſufficiencie, that it is impoſſible he can receive any good from them, that receive their Being from him. Job 35.7. <hi>If thou be righteous what giveſt thou him?</hi> Pſal. 16.2. <hi>My

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is the beſt preparative for the Heart that approacheth to God in Prayer to be firſt taken up withal: If in the ordinary Actions of our Nature the Glory of God ſhould affect our heart, and be the End, at which we ſhould aim, 1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye Eat or Drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</hi> And if the Son of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152948:157"/>God in this Pattern of Prayer begins his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions with the ſanctifying of his Name, it is certainly moſt neceſſary that the heart of him that ſets upon this Duty, be taken up with the conſideration of the Honour and Majeſty of him, who will be ſanctified by all that draw near unto him, and to carry that End through all our Prayers; leſt while we repeat the words of this Petition, we take the Name of God in vain, ſeemingly praying for the Glorifying of that Name, which we at the ſame time diſhonour; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of a due conſideration of his Majeſty, or for want of making his Glory the Rule and End of our Prayers. This firſt Petition therefore requires that the Heart be duly affected with the Glory of that Name which it invokes, and duly acted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to that Glory; and that this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be drawn through all the reſt of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
                        <p>Theſe enſuing <hi>Conſiderations</hi> therefore ariſe from the placing of this Petition firſt in this Prayer:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As thou prayeſt that his Name be <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,</hi> ſo in all thy Requeſt labour to Sanctifie the Lord in thy Heart; Sanctifie him in his Greatneſs and Majeſty with honourable and reverent thoughts of him in thy Heart; with an aweful and humble carriage both of thy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152948:157"/>inward and outward man, as in the preſence of the Great and Glorious King of Heaven and Earth: Sanctifie him in his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sovereignty, by calling upon him in Obedience to his Command and Will, who hath Commanded it; by acknowledgment of thy dependance upon him: Sanctifie him in his Power and All-ſufficiencie, by caſting thy ſelf upon him, who is Mighty to Save, and to fulfil thy moſt Extenſive and Large Requeſts: Sanctifie him in his Goodneſs and Mercy, which is infinite more large to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy Sins; to ſupply thy Wants, and to fill thee with all good Things, than thy Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities or the wideſt compaſs of thy Soul can be to ask: Sanctifie him in his Truth and Faithfulneſs, by a recumbence and reſting upon his Promiſes, that no one thing ſhall fail of all the good things that he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that no man ſhall ſeek his Face in vain: that he that hath ſaid, Whatſoever thou ſhalt ask in his Son's Name he will give it; that hath granted us acceſs unto him upon the purchaſe of his Son's Blood, will in no ſort reject thoſe Requeſts which he himſelf hath Commanded thee to make.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As thou prayeſt in the firſt place, that his Name may be ſanctified, ſo let that be the End of all thy Requeſts. Be ſure thou ask not any thing which may not be ſutable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152948:158"/>to that End, much leſs contrary to it. And in what thou askeſt agreeable to that End, let it be likewiſe for that End. Ask not thy daily Bread for thy Luſts, but that thou mayeſt Glorifie him by it, and for it. Ask not Pardon for thy Sin barely for thy eaſe from Puniſhment, much leſs to make room for new Offences, but that thereby his Mercy and Truth may be magnified, and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſtored to a condition actively to ſerve him and glorifie him. The End is firſt in intention, and is it that draws out all the Actions, and orders and directs them to that End; and every Action taſts and reliſheth of that End: Since therefore the Sanctifying of the Name of God is, or ſhould be thy chief End, and therefore is firſt in thy Requeſts, Let all thy Requeſts and Prayers be prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and chiefly directed to this; that is, or ſhould be thy chiefeſt End.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As the Glory of God ſhould be the chief of thy deſires, ſo conſequently muſt it be the Meaſure of them. That which is the chiefeſt End muſt control and over-rule all other ſubordinate Ends, if they come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it. For as it is of greateſt value, ſo it is of greateſt force. Whatſoever therefore thou askeſt, let it be ſtill with ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Glory of God; and be rather
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152948:158"/>contented to be diſappointed in thy other inferiour Ends, than that this ſhould in the leaſt degree be diſappointed: Only know, and reſt aſſured of this truth, that ſuch is the great Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God, that he hath placed all thoſe Requeſts, which are of abſolute neceſſity, to be granted thee, in ſuch an order, and path, that the granting of them always conſiſts with his Glory, and whil'ſt thou ſeekeſt them, thou canſt not miſs of glorifying him; and therefore thou mayeſt be ſure the making of his Glory the meaſure of thy Requeſt, ſhall never diſappoint thee in them: ſuch as are the pardoning thy ſins, the delivering thee from being finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſpiritual Evil: but thy other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts for temporal Benefits or Deliverances, or the particular Circumſtances of thoſe other, as the manifeſtation or aſſurance of Pardon, the degrees of ſpiritual Bleſſings, or the ſeaſons of granting them, theſe may not always lie in the Road-way of his Glory. Be content in theſe to wait upon him, and let them ſtill be asked with ſubordination to this great End; but be aſſured that by preferring his Glory as thy chief End, and ſubjecting the fulfilling of thy Requeſt to the Glory of God, thou ſhalt be no loſer in the end. Never any man was a loſer, nor ever ſhall be, that principally intends the Glory
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152948:159"/>of God, though to the diſappointment of his own particular Ends. Thou haſt done thy duty in asking, and in asking with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, if it tend moſt for the Glory of God. And thou haſt done thy Duty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented and rejoycing that thy very requeſt is diſappointed, if God receive Glory thereby: for thou haſt that which thou diddeſt in the firſt place deſire; and had thy particular Requeſt been granted, and the Glory of thy Maker ſuffered thereby, thou had'ſt been diſappointed in this firſt and great Petition, <hi>Sanctified be thy Name;</hi> which thou haſt carried along with thee as the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of all the reſt of thy Requeſts, and as that which thou haſt as it were prayed over again in every other Petition thou haſt made. Aſſure thy ſelf, if thou canſt take delight in the Glory of God, though to thy own particular damage, God will more abundantly recompence thy ſeeking of his Glory, than that very Petition which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied could have done, if granted. Thou ſerveſt a Bountiful Maſter, that will ſurely recompence thy Love of his Glory above thy own particular advantage. And thou ſerveſt a Wiſe Maſter, that will recompence thee in ſuch a kind, or at ſuch a ſeaſon, as ſhall be more ſutable, and more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than if thou had'ſt been thy own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152948:159"/>And this thou ſhalt clearly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly find, that which thou did'ſt in the firſt place ask, is granted in kind, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God; and that which thou did'ſt ask for thy ſelf, though denied in kind, is the more granted in value, thy own particular benefit. Our Saviour prayed that that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cup of death might paſs from him, yet with ſubmiſſion to the Will and Glory of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. yet his Soul muſt be made an offering for ſin; and it was ſo. The Glory and the Truth of God required it: yet <hi>he was heard in that he feared,</hi> Heb. 5.7. he ſuffers him to dye, but raiſeth him from death; and <hi>he ſaw of the travail of his Soul, and was ſatisfied,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. Thou prayeſt for deliverance from any affliction, from a Diſeaſe, from Poverty, for knowledg, or Aſſurance in ſuch a degree. It may be it will not be ſo much for the Glory of God to grant it, or to grant it yet, as for the preſent to deny it. Firſt therefore pray, <hi>Thy Name be hallowed,</hi> and though I am for the preſent denied, it is enough; I am abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, if God be glorified, though I be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Thou ſhalt find that none that waits upon him ſhall be aſhamed, if he grant thee not deliverance, he will give thee ſufficient Grace? if he deny thy recovery, he will give thee patience; if he deny thee Riches, he will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152948:160"/>give thee Contentedneſs: If he deny thee that meaſure of Grace, he will grant thee Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: If he deny thee that degree of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he will give thee Dependance. So that though thou walk in darkneſs for a while, and haſt no light, yet thou ſhalt truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon thy God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. ſuch is the Goodneſs of God, that while we ſeek his Glory in the firſt place, and other things with ſubordination to it, our other requeſt ſhall be granted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in kind, or compenſation.</p>

Pſal. 103.19. <hi>The Lord hath prepared his Throne in Heaven; his Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> Pſal. 66.7. <hi>He ruleth by his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for ever, his Eyes behold the Nations.</hi> And this he doth by planting originally in his Creatures their ſeveral Laws or Rules, by which they move; by a derivation of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Influence whereby they are ſupported and preſerved in their ſeveral Motions, Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152948:160"/>and Beings, which if he ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw but one Moment, all things would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto their Nothing; by correcting and over-ruling of all things, ſometimes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Nature, to ſhew his freedom and Sovereignty; but always by the mingling and interweaving of the Actions and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one Creature with another; by which conjunctures, though to us accidental, he brings about moſt Wiſe and various Events according to his own Counſel: So that while Natural Agents move neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Natures, Voluntary Agents move freely according to their liberty. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Agents move and are moved contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; yet every one of them apart, and all of them together, are guided and managed to the moſt infallible fulfilling of his moſt wiſe and free Counſel. And by this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom all things in the World, though to us ſeemingly caſual and confuſed, are led to Ends, and by Means, which they themſelves neither ſee nor intend. But the ſame is moſt admirably Evinced and Diſcovered in the Sacred Hiſtory; wherein we ſee how his determinate and poſitive Counſels are moſt infallibly; and yet moſt ſtrangely brought about, through divers varieties of Actions and Events, ſeemingly moſt caſual, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſly contrary, but always beſides
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152948:161"/>the Minds, Intentions, or Deſigns of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Means, as is evident among divers others, ſo eſpecially in theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that Counſel of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. and the ſtrange conjunctures that were uſed to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, that hapned from the diſlike that grew between <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethren, till the going of <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. And the ſtrange va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties that were uſed to fulfil it, from the time that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King grew jealous of them till their coming into <hi>Canaan:</hi> That ever to be admired Connſel and Promiſe of God of ſending Chriſt, and his ſuffering for Mankind, firſt manifeſted in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. And all the ſeveral particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of him and concerning him, and the moſt wonderful Connexion of Millions of Events, many of them ſeemingly inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, all of them ſeemingly caſual through the whole ſeries of 4000 years led on to the fulfilling of it, even from the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> till the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Revelation of that Mercy, for the ſake of which the World was created. To theſe may be added the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Propheſies of the Rejection of the Jews, the deſolation of the Temple, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Gentiles, for the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fulfilling whereof, it is moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, that all the Conjunctures of Natural,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152948:161"/>Voluntary; caſual Agents and Events were moſt infallibly and certainly managed by the moſt powerful hand of God. And this Kingdom is not that which is principally intended in this Petition; for this Kingdom hath been, and is come, Ever ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; only it ſhould be our deſire, that the true and wiſe knowledg and obſervation of this Kingdom may enter into the hearts of all men, that thereby we may admire and adore his Wiſdom and Power in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing of all things; that we may depend upon his All-ſufficiency, ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Diſpenſations of this Government, attribute all the Succeſſes, Events and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences in the World to his Juſtice, Power and Providence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. His Kingdom <hi>over his Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> Men and Angels, which though they are under the general Kingdom of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the conſideration above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they are under a more eſpecial King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then other Creatures. To theſe he hath given Underſtanding and Will, and ſo they are capable not only of a ſubjection to the Will of his Counſel, as they are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but of an Active Obedience to the Will of his Command, [as they are reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures] and ſo are ſubjects of his Juſtice in Rewards and Puniſhments, as well
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152948:162"/>as of his Power. And in reference to this Kingdom it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.14. <hi>Juſtice and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.6. <hi>The Seepter of his Kingdom is a right Scepter.</hi> Now <hi>the Adminiſtration</hi> of this Kingdom conſiſteth eſpecially in theſe things: 1. In giving the Children of Men a Law to be their Rule. 2. In diſpenſing Rewards and Puniſhments according to the obedience or diſobedience of this Law. 3. In Protection.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As touching <hi>the Law given to Man:</hi> In the firſt Creation of Man he did acquaint Man with his Will and Mind, and ſurely by ſome ſpecial Manifeſtation of it, did reveal that Law unto him which ſhould be a Rule of Righteouſneſs to him and all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And as he gave to all things propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, inclinations, and motions ſuitable to the ſeveral degrees of their beings, ſo to Man he gave a Law or Rule ſuitable to his Nature, and by a Manifeſtation convenient for the condition of his Nature. And though Man by his Fall introduced that diſorder and diſconformity to that Law, whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unable to keep it, yet many of thoſe Principles of Righteouſneſs, which God had manifeſted unto him, he retained in his knowledge, and traduced to his poſterity. And theſe as they grew corrupted by the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152948:162"/>corruption of our Nature, and forgotten, ſo he did re-imprint them upon men by the ſeveral Acts of his Providence: Sometimes by new publication of his Law unto ſome perſons, which was by that means traduced over to divers others: thus the Law given to <hi>Noah,</hi> the Law given to the Jewes, was queſtionleſs propagated and derived over to others by tradition and relation: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by inlightning and exciting men of Eminence, as divers of the Heathen Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, who were Eminent in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but moſt ordinarily and univerſally ſending down into the Conſciences of men ſome diſcoveries of his Will, and inclinations to acknowledg them, and to obey them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. a Law written in their Hearts, their Conſciences alſo bearing witneſs. So that there can ſcarcely be found any time or perſon wherein God's Providence did not by ſome of theſe wayes convey, at leaſt ſome Directions of Righteouſneſs, which ſhould be the Rule, by which they ſhould live, and by which they ſhould be judged. So <hi>that they that have ſinned without the Law, ſhould periſh without the Law; and they that have ſinned in the Law, ſhould be judged by the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.12. that is, Somewhat of the Will of God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs is derived to all men, though to ſome more, to ſome leſs; to ſome
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152948:163"/>by a more clear Diſpenſation; to ſome by a more obſcure Diſpenſation: yet ſuch is the Exact Juſtice of God, that though he might Judge all Mankind according to the Exacteſt Rule of his Law given to Man even in his Innocency, yet, that Every Mouth may be ſtopped, he will Judge them according to ſo much of his Law, as he hath communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. He will not Judge the Heathen that never heard of the Law of God ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed to the Jewes, by that Law; but by that manifeſtation or conviction of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that he hath. Thus if he ſin he ſhall be condemned without the Law, that is, without calling in any other Law to Judge him by, then that Law which hath been in ſome meaſure declared unto him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the Adminiſtration of this Kingdom over men is by giving them a Law, ſo there is likewiſe an <hi>Execution of that Law by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> of Obedience, <hi>and by Puniſhments</hi> of Diſobedience. And this God publiſhed in the infancy of the World; <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doſt not well, ſin lyes at the door.</hi> Pſal. 62.12. <hi>Thou rendreſt to every man according to his works.</hi> Diſobedience to this Law of God obligeth to Puniſhment upon a double ground: 1. As a natural and a Juſt conſequence of an unjuſt violation of a Juſt Duty, in as much as every
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152948:163"/>Creature owes an infinite ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Soveraign Commands of him that gives it Being. 2. As a conſequence of that Sanction, that is expreſly annexed to the Law ſo given: <hi>In the day that thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> Obedience on the other ſide is followed with a Reward, not out of a natural conſequent, or a proportion between the Obedience and the Reward; for every Creature owes obedience to God, though there were no reward at all; we have therein done but our Duty, and God cannot be a debtor to the beſt of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for their beſt works. <hi>Job</hi> 35.7. <hi>If thou be righteous what giveſt thou him?</hi> but out of the Free Goodneſs and Bounty of our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, who is pleaſed to make himſelf a debtor to his Creatures obedience, by his Free Promiſe of a Reward, and annexing of it to the Obedience of this Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.12. Alſo <hi>to thee, O Lord, belongeth Mercy, for thou rendereſt to every man according to his works;</hi>
                           <q rend="margQuotes">As if he ſhould have ſaid; O Lord, all thy Creatures owe an univerſal Subjection and Obedience to thy Command, and when they have done what thou commandeſt, they pay but the juſt tribute unto Thee for their Being; and therefore when they have done all that thou requireſt, they muſt ſit down and ſay, We are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152948:164"/>we have done but what was our duty, and cannot challenge any reward at thy hands. They owe thee more for their Being, that thou haſt already given them, than all their ſervice and obedience can amount unto. It is thy Mercy, not thy Juſtice, that hath annexed any further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to that Duty, which we owe unto thee. All the challenge that thy Creature can make to any Reward of his choiceſt Obedience, is ſtill founded upon thy Mercy, who (though we are in all this but unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servants) art pleaſed to be to us a Bountiful Maſter, in giving that Reward to the obedience of thy Creature, which only thine Own Free Goodneſs did at firſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe. Even ſo Lord, becauſe Mercy pleaſeth thee.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. In his moſt Wiſe and Special <hi>Providing</hi> for them, <hi>Diſpoſing</hi> of them, and <hi>Protecting</hi> of them. The General Providence of God reacheth every Creature; but, if that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom and Power can admit of any degrees in the way of its execution, it is more eminently, at leaſt acted, in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over his reaſonable Creatures: <hi>Luke</hi> 12.7. <hi>Fear not, ye are of more value than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sparrows.</hi> Matth. 6.30. <hi>Shall he not much more cloath you?</hi> And this Special Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Kingdom is ſeen in more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152948:164"/>diſpoſing and ordering of the ways and events of Particular men: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.24. <hi>Man's goings are of the Lord. How can a man then underſtand his own way?</hi> of Societies or Companies of Men. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. <hi>hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitations:</hi> in protecting them againſt the power and malice of Evil Angels, reſtraining them from thoſe Evils, that their malice and natural power is able and willing to Effect, <hi>Job</hi> 1.12.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. His Kingdom <hi>over his Church:</hi> and this in a more ſpecial manner is the Kingdom of God. And herein we conſider:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The King</hi> of this Kingdom: God by an Eternal Decree hath appointed his Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the King of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 26.7. <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy Hill.</hi> Pſalm 110.2. <hi>Rule thou in the middeſt of thine Enemies.</hi> And hence it is called frequently the Kingdom of Chriſt: <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. the <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſometime <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God,</hi> Epheſ. 5.5. <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> in the immediate admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, and the Kingdom of God, who hath delegated and ſubſtituted him unto this adminiſtration, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers, being made ſubject unto him,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152948:165"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. firſt the Kingdom of Chriſt, till he ſhall have Judged all men; and then the Kingdom of the Father: when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to his Father, that God may be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28. And <hi>the Regal Office of Chriſt</hi> over his Church prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpecteth theſe two things: 1. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering to himſelf a people. The whole World was by Sin reduced under a ſubjection to an Uſurper, the Prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience. And this Kingdom of his was a Kingdom of darkneſs, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And the Subjects of this Kingdom were a People of darkneſs: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs.</hi> And by the advantage of this darkneſs, this Prince of darkneſs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the World as he pleaſed; for they knew not whither they went: and by and from this darkneſs, this Prince led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Continent, or rather condition of his Kingdom, a Kingdom of Sin; and Sin, as the Vice-Roy of this Prince of darkneſs, did reign in the World, and had dominion over it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 14. and by Sin he led his Subjects into another Region of his Kingdom, into the Kingdom of death: Sin reigned unto death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. and then death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. Now as God was pleaſed,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152948:165"/>by a Mighty hand, to go and take him a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the mid'ſt of another Nation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.34. So Chriſt redeems him a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of every Tongue and Kindred, and People and Nation, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.9. out of the mid'ſt of his Enemies. He came to deſtroy the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. binds this ſtrong man that kept the houſe, and reſcues his priſoners from him.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He came <hi>a Light</hi> into the World, and diſpelled and ſcattered that darkneſs, which was the principal Engine whereby the Prince of this world did rule. <hi>John</hi> 1.5. <hi>The Light ſhined into darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi> And at the very dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Light into the World, the Prince of darkneſs falls from Heaven like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.18. And this was that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Prince of this world was Judged; that is, all his deceits and methods, and wiles, and abuſes of Mankind, were diſcovered and detected, <hi>John</hi> 18.11. And by this Light we are tranſlated from the power of darkneſs into the Kingdom of his Son, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13. are become partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. are become light, and children of the light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                        <p>And as he came with Light to take away that <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.1. So 2. he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152948:166"/>came with a Treaſury of <hi>Merit</hi> to expiate the guilt, and a Treaſury of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to cover the ſtain, and take away the power of ſin; to re-imprint the Image of God, that was defaced by ſin; to reſcue the heart from the love of ſin, and conſequently from the power of ſin; to tranſmit into the Soul new Principles, new Affections, new Wills. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> As he came with Light to rectifie the Underſtanding, ſo he came with <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to rectifie the Will: The ſtrength of a King reſts in the Love and Will of his People: when Chriſt conquers the Will from the Love and Submiſſion to ſin, he conquers Man from the Dominion and Kingdom of ſin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And as thus by Light he conquered the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and by Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Kingdom of Sin; ſo he comes with <hi>Life</hi> alſo, and conquers us from the Kingdom of Death. When our Saviour died, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Chambers of Death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered this King of Terrors; took away the malignity and ſting of it by taking away Sin, the ſting of Death; healed theſe bitter waters by his own paſſing through them, and by his Reſurrection triumphed over the power of death for us, by the vertue of that Reſurrection, delivering our Souls from the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152948:166"/>ſecond death, and our Bodies from the firſt death, and giving us a moſt infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a final victory over death, by an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and bleſſed Reſurrection. Thus Death is ſwallowed up in Victory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And as Chriſt hath purchaſed him a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Victory, ſo his Regal Office is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>in the Government</hi> of this people, that he hath ſo acquired. He hath given them a Law to Live by, the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, which makes them free from the Law of ſin and of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. The Law of God vindicated from the falſe gloſſes, which the corruption of men had in ſucceſſion of time put upon it; a Law ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſtrengthned and actuated by the Love of God wrought in the Soul; a Law, though of the higheſt Perfection and Purity, yet, accompanied with the Grace and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt, to Enable us to perform it in ſome meaſure; and accompanied with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt to pardon, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to cover our defects in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. He hath given them a new heart, and this Law of his written in this heart: He hath given them of his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a Spirit of Life to Quicken them, and of Power to Enable them to Obey. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, notwithſtanding this conqueſt of Chriſt of a People to himſelf, they are ſtill
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152948:167"/>beſet with Enemies, that would reduce them to their former bondage, he watcheth over them, and in them, by his Grace, waſting and weakning and reſiſting their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by new ſupplyes and influences from him; quickning their hearts by renewed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivations of Life and Spirit from him, which otherwiſe would ſink and die under the weight of their own Earth; encountering Temptations, that, like Foggs and Vapours, ariſe out of our own fleſh; or, like ſtorms or ſnares, are raiſed or placed by the Devil againſt us; either by diverting them, or by giving ſufficient Grace to oppoſe them. Theſe and the like adminiſtrations doth our Saviour uſe, which though they are ſecret and not eaſily diſcerned by us, and though they are ordered without any noiſe or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yet they are works of greater Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and of greater Concernment, and of equal reality, with all the viſible adminiſtrations of things in this world, which are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our ſenſe, and are the effects of that inviſible Government of Chriſt, and of that Promiſe of his, <hi>Behold I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, even unto the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 28.20. This is that Kingdom of God within them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21. conſiſting in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. caſting down Imaginations, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152948:167"/>high thing, that Exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As in his Government, ſo his Regal Office is Evidenced in <hi>his Judgment.</hi> And this Judgment of his, being one of the Acts or Adminiſtrations of this Kingdom, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes called the Kingdom of God. His Judgment of Abſolution and Reward to his Subjects, and his Judgment of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Deſtruction to the Rebels and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And as we have the conſideration of the King of this Kingdom, and conſequently of his Subjects, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints:</hi> So the various Adminiſtrations of this Kingdome are frequently called the Kingdome of God, and the Myſteries of the Kingdome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11, 24, 31, 44, 45, 47. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.1, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as the Adminiſtrations of this Kingdom are often called the Kingdom, ſo are <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> of this adminiſtration.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Word, or Goſpel of the Kingdome,</hi> which muſt be preached through the whole World, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.14. and is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the miniſtration of an Angel to diſpence it to all Nations, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.6. That great Engin which though ſeemingly

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152948:168"/>a plain prediction of poverty, ſcorns, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and Death to thoſe that entertain it, and with a promiſe of future Life that they never ſaw, nor can ſee till they ſee this no more, ſhould conquer Millions of Souls to the profeſſion and Love of Chriſt, and to an auſtere, ſelf-denying, deſpiſed Life here, doth evidence and convince that there is the ſtrength and Wiſdom of God that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this wonderful, yet moſt poſitively predicted conqueſt of the World.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The work of the Spirit</hi> of God, preparing and pre-diſpoſing the Heart to the receiving of the Goſpel of the Kingdom; convincing the Heart of that Sin and that Death, which hath overſpread the whole race of Mankind, and of the Truth and Efficacy and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of that Redemption which came by Chriſt, and is publiſhed in that Word; ſtriving and contending with, and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and over-ruling the oppoſition of the will againſt it; Calming and quieting and rectifying the diſtempers and diſorders and miſplacings of our affections; oppoſing and ſubduing the luſts of our ſenſual appetite; inlightning and quickning and cleanſing the conſcience, and bringing it about to take part with God and the actings of this Spirit upon our Souls; mingling the word of the Goſpel, conveyed into the Heart, with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152948:169"/>and powerful Energy, whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Seed of Life</hi> in the Heart growing unto Eternal Life. And thus, as at firſt the Motion of the Spirit of God upon the face of the waters, and the powerful word of Command produced the ſeveral Creatures; ſo by the like Motion of the Spirit upon the Heart, and the powerful call of the Word of Chriſt by the publication of the Goſpel, is wrought this <hi>Second Creation</hi> of the new Creature, Epheſ. 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And theſe two great Inſtruments produce in the Heart two active or operative Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which after they are produced are not only an Effect of the work of God, but alſo become inſtrumental for the increaſe of it; <hi>viz.</hi> Faith and Love: <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby we receive this Meſſage of Salvation, and entertain it, and reſt upon it; and <hi>Love,</hi> whereby, out of the apprehenſion of this great Love of God to us, we love him again; we love him becauſe he loved us Firſt. And this Love of God ingageth the Soul to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience to the Will of God. The Miſery, from which we are redeemed, is ſo great; the Price, by which we are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo invaluable; the Glory and Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to which we are redeemed, ſo full; and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152948:169"/>all theſe appearing ſo to the Soul by Faith, that the Soul can think nothing too much to return to that God, that hath ſo freely done ſo much for it. Thus Faith worketh by Love. And this is that <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> that is <hi>within us,</hi> Luk. 17.20. the ſubjection of the whole Soul to the Scepter and Rule of Chriſt. If he command Purity of Life, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of all things, denying our ſelves, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying our Luſts, laying down our Lives, the Soul is tutored to that ſubjection unto the Will of Chriſt, that it chearfully obeys him in this, and whatever he commands. This is that Kingdom of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. conſiſting in Righteouſneſs, a full Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Soul to the Will of God, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolute Rule of Righteouſneſs; Peace, upon the ſenſe and belief of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, through him that is our Peace; and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, upon the apprehenſion of the Protection and Love of Chriſt, our King, and that Glory which he hath moſt aſſuredly prepared for all his Subjects.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We have <hi>the Degrees of the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Kingdom,</hi> Here and Hereafter: the Kingdom of Grace, and the Kingdom of Glory; both making but one Kingdom of God under different degrees of manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God by his Word and Spirit caſts into
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152948:170"/>the Soul <hi>a Seed of Life,</hi> like that grain of Muſtard-ſeed, whereunto the Kingdom of Heaven is reſembled, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. And this ſeed of Life abideth in the Heart, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. And there it quickens, and faſhions, and moulds the Heart to the Image of God: it oppoſeth and ſtruggleth againſt Luſts and Temptations, which labour to ſtifle and to kill this Seed of Life; and, like the leaven that was hid in the 3 meaſures of Meal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.33. It doth by degrees, aſſimulate the whole inward Man to this living principle, and conforms the Life unto it. Now though this principle of Life is thus operative, yet in reſpect of the outward view it is a hidden Life. The External appearance of this Life, is reſerved till Chriſt, who is our Life, ſhall appear; and then ſhall that hidden Life be revealed, Coloſ. 3.4. <hi>Behold, now we are the Sons of God.</hi> 1 John 3.2. <hi>But it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him.</hi> By this ſeed of Grace, ſown in our Hearts, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God; and of this Sonſhip we have a ſecret Evidence in our own Souls; but there ſhall be a fuller Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it when Chriſt, who is our Life, ſhall appear. So then, the Kingdom of Grace and of Glory are the ſame Kingdom, but under a different manifeſtation: that, a concealed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152948:170"/>Kingdom, a ſeed in the ground; this, the Manifeſtation of that Kingdom, a ſeed in the Tree.</p>
                        <p>To conclude; When thou prayeſt, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> let thy Soul enlarge it ſelf in theſe, or the like deſires.</p>

The <hi>Word of both Teſtaments.</hi> The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience is corrupted, and many times doth not his duty; the word of the Spirit of God is not ſo eaſily diſcerned by our fleſhly Nature, and many times we miſtake the voice of our own ſpirit for the Spirit of God: he hath therefore in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Mercy given us a ſtanding Rule,

To ſhew our <hi>Dependance</hi> upon him: All Creatures, as they are eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon God in their being and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſo according to the meaſure of their power they teſtifie that Dependance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.21. <hi>The young Lyons ſeek their meat from God.</hi> Pſal. 147.9. <hi>He giveth the Beaſts their food, and to the young Ravens which cry.</hi> Pſal. 145.15. <hi>The Eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou giveſt them their meat in due ſeaſon.</hi> There is a ſecret and unknown teſtification, even in the ſenſible Creatures, of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God for their livelihood, and much more is required, and that moſt juſtly, from Man: It is an act of Mercy and Bounty for God to promiſe and to give; and an act of Duty and Recognition for Man to ſeek.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It brings the Soul more to ſee and to acknowledge and magnifie that <hi>Mercy</hi> that is given, when it is firſt ſued out from God by Prayer. A Bleſſing obtained upon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152948:185"/>Prayer carries a more immediate impreſſion of the Liberality of God, than when it is given unſought for.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It makes a Bleſſing the more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when obtained; and the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and contenting in the enjoyment; when a man, together with the Mercy he receives, receives alſo a ſenſe of the Mercy and Goodneſs of God coming with it: and as in reſpect of this concomitance, ſo it moſt times falls out, that ſuch bleſſings ſo obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are more ſuitable, and ſeaſonable, and ample, and uſeful, than ſuch as come in an ordinary way of Providence.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It fits a man with a better mind to uſe them with Thankfulneſs unto God; with Sobriety, and yet with Cheerfulneſs; when a man ſhall conſider that this bleſſing I had from the hands of the Almighty God, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to me by that means that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, Prayer bottomed upon his Promiſe. The diſturbance that growes to any man in any condition, is either out of a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his condition to a right mind or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or a diſproportion of his mind to a right fruition: A Bleſſing obtained by Prayer avoids both; it brings a proportionable good to his mind and deſire; and it ſuits the Mind with a proportionable temper to the bleſſing. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of a man
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152948:185"/>to whom God had given Riches and Wealth and Honour, ſo that he wanted nothing that his heart could deſire; yet God gave him not power to eat thereof: the diſcompoſure of his Mind robbed him of fruition as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he had not had the poſſeſſion. But the bleſſing of Wealth gotten By Prayer, is accompanied with a Mind to uſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and chearfully, yet ſoberly and humbly. Sin hath put a curſe in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they prove unuſeful; and it hath put a Curſe in the Soul, that it corrupts the Creature, as an ill ſtomach doth good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, ſo that oftentimes they are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Exceſs and Intemperance, of Pride and Haughtineſs, of Carnal Confidence and forgetting of God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. <hi>leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord?</hi> Prayer is by the free Goodneſs of God made a means to take out the Curſe from both; it ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Creature. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Every Creature of God is ſanctified by the Word and Prayer:</hi> by the Word of Command given to the creature to make it ſerviceable; and by the Word of Promiſe given to the uſer; and by Prayer laying hold upon that Promiſe, and ſuing out that Bleſſing that is contained in it; and it ſanctifies the heart, keeps it in dependance upon God, in confidence in him, in Sobriety before him; it teacheth him
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152948:186"/>that the Bleſſings of this Life come from him, are his Bleſſings; my Corn, and my Wine, and my Oyl. And accordingly the Heart is tutored to uſe them with all Moderation, Thankfulneſs and Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Give us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Give</hi> us our Bread, not Pay it us as a Duty. The beſt Title we have to all our Bleſſings is Free Gift. God did not, nor could at firſt owe to any thing its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and having given a Being to any thing, he owes it not Preſervation, nor the means of it; but the gift of the latter is as free as of the former. When God ſaid to man, <hi>In the ſweat of thy brows thou ſhalt eat thy bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. he gave him not his Bread as the wages of his Labour, but annexed his Toil and Labour as the Curſe of his Life; and yet ſuch is his Mercy that he gives us our Bread for asking it. Matt. 7.11. <hi>How much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</hi>
                           <q rend="margQuotes">O Lord, I have no title to the neceſſaries of my Life, but thy free gift and bounty; and had I any, yet my continual Sins do every moment forfeit that title. The Beggar, that begs bread at my door, hath a better right to the bread he begs, as againſt me, than I have to the bread I eat, as from thee. I come therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee for the neceſſaries of my life with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152948:186"/>all abhorrence and deteſtation of any Merit in my ſelf to deſerve them: they are thine before thou giveſt them; and they are not mine unleſs thou giveſt them; and when thou haſt given them they are ſtill thine; and bleſſed be thy Name that thou art pleaſed to give them me for the asking.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Give us our Bread.</hi> We cannot give it our ſelves, our Good is not in our own hands nor power; it is he that giveth thee power to get Wealth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16.19. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Bleſſings my Labours and Projections will prove fruitleſs; it is vain to riſe early, and to go to bed late, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.2. or if they arrive to acquire the Bread I want, yet he can blow upon it and makes holes in my Bag, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.6, 9.

I will therefore be honeſtly induſtrious to get my Bread; for it is my Duty. Gen. 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy brows thou ſhalt eat thy bread.</hi> But I will not be ſolicitous touching the Event; for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152948:187"/>
                           <hi>he hath ſaid I will not leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Heb. 13.5. And if the Providence of God ſecond my Endeavours, yet I will not ſacrifice to my Net. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16. But with acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment bleſs the hand of God that gives me the Bread, and labour and pray to make it bread to me; for man cannot live by bread alone, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.4. But by that word of Bleſſing whereby he makes it my dayly bread.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <q rend="margQuotes">Give us our bread, yet if thou give it not, give us Contentedneſs; for what cauſe have we to murmur at the denial of that which thou art not bound to give: or if thou turn our dayly bread to bread of Carefulneſs, or of Affliction, yet give us Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and we ſhall be able to live upon this bread.

                           <head>This Day, or Day by Day:</head>
                           <p>And why not bread for to morrow, as well as for to day? the reaſon of the Prayer is contained in our Saviours Command, Matt. 6.32. <hi>Take no thought for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> And the Reaſons of that Command are theſe:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. To keep us in a continual <hi>Dependance</hi>
                              <pb n="115" facs="tcp:152948:187"/>upon God. And this our Saviour enforceth upon the conſideration of the very Fowls, Matt. 6.26. <hi>They ſowe not, neither do they reap, nor gather into Barns, yet your Heavenly Father feedeth them;</hi> and that, <hi>in due ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 145. <hi>And are ye not much better than they?</hi> When <hi>Elias</hi> was at Gods immediate finding, the Ravens brought him Meat in the Wilderneſs at ſeaſonable times. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies beyond neceſſity of the preſent are apt to make us either vainly profuſe, or vainly confident. An Example of the firſt we have in the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.12. that would have all his Portion at once that belonged to him: he waſted it in riotous living, which he did not before, when his Fathers care meaſured out his Supplies according to his Exigencies and Occaſions. An inſtance of the latter we have in the Rich Man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. When his Store out-grew his Receipt, ſo that he projecteth the building of greater Barns, he then ſets up his reſt; <hi>thou haſt much laid up for many years, eat, drink, and be merry. Iſrael</hi> was in leſs danger when fed as it were from hand to mouth in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, then when he had eaten and was full; when his Herds, and Flocks, and Silver, and Gold were multiplied, then his heart was in danger to be lifted up and to forget God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3, 13, 14. And accordingly it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152948:188"/>proved when <hi>Jeſurun</hi> waxed Fat, he kicked, and forſook the Lord which made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his Salvation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. And ſuch is the baſeneſs and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pride of our hearts, that could we have our turns ſerved by any other means, than from the hands of God, we would never ſeek unto him: and when we have any thing beyond the exigence of our preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we preſently make that our confidence. We had rather be beholden to any thing than to him, and rather truſt in any thing than in him. Therefore in great condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the waywardneſs of our Natures, he is often pleaſed to keep the Treaſury of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bleſſings in his own hands, deliver them out by little and little according to our preſent Exigencies, that ſo though the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Natures will not, yet the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Nature and his wiſe Diſpenſation enforceth us to make our often Addreſſes to him to beg our Bread of him, as often as we have neceſſity to Eat, that thereby we may learn to depend upon him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Though our fooliſh hearts cannot think ſo, yet certain it is, that God is the beſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of his own Bleſſings for us. He huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands them better for us than we can our ſelves; diſpenceth them with more Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Seaſonableneſs, Convenience, than if
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:152948:188"/>they were at our own taking. He knows what proportion is fitteſt, what time ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableſt: and therefore we are taught by this part of this Petition to truſt God with his own Bleſſings, and with the diſpencing of them. Our Father is a Wiſe and Merciful Father, and we are fooliſh and inconſiderate Children. Let us truſt him with our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſhall certainly be better managed in his hands than in ours. Though he gives not out to day what is fit for to morrow, yet he hath the ſame Store and Mercy and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to morrow that he hath to day, or had yeſterday. And if he gives me enough for this day upon my Petition, what need I trouble my ſelf about to morrow? when to morrow comes I will beg it, as I did to day; and I doubt not but he will deal as bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to morrow, as he hath done this day. Therefore I will beg to day for the Bread of this day, and beg to morrow Bread for to morrow, and not anticipate my Duty by begging to day Bread, for to morrow.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To put us in mind of our Mortality. Why ſhall I be ſolicitous for to morrow, when I know not how God will diſpoſe of me before to morrow comes? Who can tell what a day may bring forth? I will wait therefore all my appointed time till my change cometh, <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. and if God ſpare
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152948:189"/>me my life till to morrow, it will be then ſeaſonable to beg Bread for that Life, as I have done for this day.</p>

                              <hi>Bread.</hi> We have herein theſe two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>The Extent</hi> of it: Bread is the Staff of Life, the ſtrength of Life, Pſal. 104.15. <hi>Bread which ſtrengtheneth mans heart.</hi> If this be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it makes a famine, though there be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of other things; and if this be had, the want of other things may be born: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comprehends all the conveniencies for the ſupport of our Natures. Iſa. 55.2. <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend your mony for that which is not bread?</hi> Pſal. 132.15. <hi>I will abundantly bleſs her proviſion, and ſatisfie her poor with bread.</hi> So that when I beg my daily Bread, I beg for all the conveniencies for the ſupport of my life.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>The Reſtriction</hi> of it: Our Saviour teacheth us to pray for Food for our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and conveniency, not for our curioſity or ſuperfluity; and with <hi>Agur</hi> to deſire food convenient for us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had their daily ſupply of Bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they were not contented, but tempted God and asked Meat for their Luſts,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152948:189"/>Pſal. 78.18. <hi>And they were not eſtranged from their Luſts, but while the meat was yet in their mouthes, the wrath of God fell upon them.</hi> A Petition for Supplyes to be conſumed upon our Luſts, is with more Mercy denyed than granted, <hi>James</hi> 4.3. When we are to ask for Temporal Supplies, our Saviour teacheth us in this Petition, Modeſty, Moderation, and Contentation; if we have Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therewith to be content: not but that Abundance is a Bleſſing, and ſuch as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God not only allows, but requires a cheerful and thankful uſe, Deut. 28.47. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou ſerveſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs and gladneſs of heart for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things, therefore ſhalt thou ſerve thine Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. Wealth and Abundance are Bleſſings of God, ſuch as we muſt receive with Thankfulneſs, and uſe with Cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sobriety, and Liberality: But we have no promiſe to be Rich or to have Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; if God gives it, he is better than his Promiſe, and we have great cauſe therein to bleſs his Name: but we have a Promiſe of ſupply of our neceſſities of Nature, and the Promiſe of God is the foundation of our Prayer. We have commiſſion to pray for Bread, not for Delicacies or Superfluities. Theſe, if given, may be lawfully, and muſt be thankfully uſed; but if not given, we
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152948:190"/>muſt live contentedly and thankfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. God knows what proportion beſt fitteth us, and if he gives us our daily Bread, he gives us as much as we have a commiſſion to ask; and yet by asking only for daily Bread, we are not bound to ask meerly for the neceſſity of the ſupport of Life, but for a comfortable and convenient ſupport according to that condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God's Providence hath placed us. That may be Bread to ones Meal for his Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which may be Quails to anothers Meal for his Luſts. And this variety may ariſe by the difference of ſtations or degrees (that may be but Bread for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Table, which may be Quails for a meaner perſon:) the difference of relations and dependencies, the difference of tempers and conſtitutions of body, the difference of ſeaſons and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. There may be a Seaſon when our Lord gives us a commiſſion to eat whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Soul deſireth, ſo it be done before the Lord, and as in his preſence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.26. And there is a Seaſon when ſlaying of Oxen, and killing Sheep, and eating Fleſh, is an iniquity not to be purged, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12, 13, 14. The Wiſe God, that ordereth and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all times, and perſons, and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth with the ſame Wiſdom fit them with ſuitable Concomitants and Adjuncts.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152948:190"/>He hath made every thing beautiful in its time, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11.</p>
                           <p>But beſides this Bread for our Bodies, there is <hi>Bread for our Souls,</hi> which comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Petition: The <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> and the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> John 6.33. this is the Life of our Souls. And as much as the Good and Support and Life of our Souls is of more concernment to us, than the Life of our Bodies, ſo is the Bread of our Souls of more concernment for us to ask, than the Bread of our Bodies: this is Chriſt, John 6.34. <hi>I am the Bread of Life, he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Bread like the Widows Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Meal, that ſhall never diminiſh unto all Eternity. This Bread our Lord hath been pleaſed already to give us, Chriſt and his fulneſs; and nothing is wanting if we have but a hand to receive it. And this Bread we eat when we believe the Truth of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; when we often contemplate upon the Mercy of God in giving him; and upon that mighty Salvation which in him he hath given us; when we have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto him for Grace and Mercy; when we carry unto him all our ſtock of Love, and Admiration, and Dependence, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbence, and Reſolution of Spirit. And here we find Bread for our Souls in the moſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152948:191"/>comprehenſive latitude, accommodate to every condition of the Soul: Here is Bread to feed and to ſtrengthen it, the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt; Phyſick to cure and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, the Satisfaction and Merit of Chriſt; Varieties to feaſt and to refreſh it, the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, Joy in believing, unſpeakable and full of Glory; Bread that will ſatisfie, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatiate; but the more we feed upon him, the greater is our plenty, and the better our ſtomach.</p>
                           <p>To conclude then the whole conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Petition; When I pray for my <hi>daily Bread,</hi> my Soul doth or ſhould run out into ſuch thoughts as theſe:
<q rend="margQuotes">O Lord, thou did'ſt at firſt freely give me my Being, I could not deſerve it when I was not: The ſame Title that I have to my Being, I have to my Preſervation, and Support of my Being; it is ſtill free gift, and therefore I come to thee for my Bread upon no other terms, than as a poor Beggar to a moſt bountiful Lord. And becauſe thou haſt commanded me to caſt my care upon thee, therefore I ſeek my Bread of thee for this day, which thou haſt hitherto lent me. I deſire to truſt thee with my Portion, and it is my happineſs that my Portion is not in my own hands, but in thine. Give therefore, I pray thee, Bread for this day,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152948:191"/>and when to morrow comes, I will beg Bread of thee for to morrow; and if thou giveſt me this day ſupplies beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of this day, I will uſe it thankfully, and nevertheleſs dependingly; for I will renew my Petition for my daily Bread, ſtill. It is thy bleſſing that gives my Bread pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to nouriſh me. And that which is Bread to day, and ſufficient for to morrow, may without thy bleſſing upon it, like the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> Manna, kept beyond thy Command, be Worms to morrow: And becauſe thou haſt promiſed, that verily I ſhall be fed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. upon that promiſe of thine I beg food and cloathing convenient for me. If thou giveſt me no more, or not ſo much, give me Contentedneſs, and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and if thou giveſt me more, give me Thankfulneſs for it, Sobriety in the uſe of it, and Liberality in the diſpencing of it. In giving me but Enough, I am Steward for my ſelf; and in giving me more than Enough, I am but a Steward of that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance for others. But above all, Ever give me of the Bread of Life, that whileſt my Body is fed, my Soul may not be ſtarved, either for want of that Everlaſting Bread, or for want of an appetite to it.</q>

And as it was juſt in reſpect of the Perſon contracting, ſo it was juſt in reſpect of the Manner of the <hi>Contract:</hi> the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152948:192"/>Law that was his covenant was a juſt and righteous Law, a Law ſutable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and power of his Nature: Again, the Bleſſedneſs, which by his obedience he was to hold, was not of his own creating nor obtaining; it was the free gift of God, and it is but reaſonable that the Lord of this gift might give it in what manner he pleaſed; and it could not be unjuſt that the Lord, that gave him this Bleſſedneſs ſhould give it him under what Conditions he pleaſed: but he gave it him under moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and juſt Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a moſt juſt and reaſonable Law, which ſuited with the ability and perfection of his Nature; and therefore when, upon the breach of Covenant by Man, he withdrew that bleſſedneſs from him and his poſterity, he did no more than what was moſt juſt for him to do. And thus we ſtand Guilty of that Sin which our firſt Father committed, and are deprived of that Bleſſedneſs and Life which our firſt Father had; and the Privation of that Bleſſedneſs and Immortality is Death. Rom. 5.12. <hi>By one Man ſin entered into the World, and death by Sin;</hi> and Verſ. 19. <hi>By one Mans Diſobedience many were made Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>In Adam all die.</hi> And by this Sin of Adam <hi>all were made Sinners,</hi> by theſe <hi>two wayes:</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>By actual participation</hi> of his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for we were then in him: but that is not all, for upon that reaſon every Man ſhould ſtand guilty of all the Sins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any of his Progenitors ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> which ſeems not to agree with the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Almighty God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. <hi>The Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father.</hi> But the caſe is not alike; for <hi>Adam</hi> was created in integrity and perfection, in an ability to perform the Law, and ſo was a fit perſon to ſtipulate for his poſterity. 2 And as he was a perſon ſo qualified, ſo the Covenant was made between God and him, both for him, and his poſterity; and 3 As we ſuffer in the penalty of his Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſo we had enjoyed the benefit of his Obedience; we had come into the World with the ſame Liberty of Will, and Integrity, and Perfection of Nature that he had: But all theſe are wanting in any other perſon in the World: 1. A defect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is gone over all, that none is fit to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate for himſelf and his poſterity: 2. No ſuch contract hath been at any time made between God and any other Man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>By a neceſſary Conſequence;</hi> for God having juſtly withdrawn from Man his Bleſſedneſs and Perfection; and Sin having corrupted and imbaſed his Nature, we by
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152948:193"/>propagation from him derive a corrupted, depraved Nature, full of impotence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and diſorder. Job. 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> God was pleaſed to communicate to Man a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Eſſence of a Man; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him a degree of Purity, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, Wiſdom, and Perfection beyond the compaſs of his Natural ſubſiſtence: but this latter was communicated to him under a covenant, which when he broke he loſt, and not only loſt that, but even ſtained, and corrupted, and imbaſed that very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that after he had ſinned, he retained. And this is <hi>the old Man</hi> corrupt, according to the deceivable Luſts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. A body of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. And this Depravation of our Nature was followed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Corruption, and at laſt with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Nature: and that not only in thoſe who had ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, by an actual breach of an expreſs Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. But in all that were partakers of <hi>Adams</hi> corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even Infants; and ſo Death paſſed over all.</p>
                        <p>And as thus we partake of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> as well by being virtually actors in it, as alſo by derivation of a corrupted Nature; ſo
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152948:194"/>this corruption of our Nature produceth in all our Lives continued and renewed <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sins,</hi> the conceptions of Luſt. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. And theſe <hi>Actual Sins,</hi> according to the difference of thoſe commands of God, which are violated, are either Sins of Omiſſion, or of Commiſſion: and both come under the extent of this Petition, by the name of Sins or Treſpaſſes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. by the Name of Debts, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. For we owe unto God Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Obedience, and every Violation of that duty leaves us ſo much indebted unto God: the leaſt of which is impoſſible to be paid when once incurred; becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to make that not to have been, which hath already been, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us by all our future Obedience, (were it as exact as the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires) to expiate a Sin paſt; for ſtill that perfect obedience is no more then we owe; we have therein but done our duty and are but unprofitable Servants; but if it were poſſible to think that one act of perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God would expiate for any Sin paſt, yet ſuch is the Corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that not one ſuch act can be found: there is in our beſt actions a mixture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of ſome defect or other, that makes it become the ſubject ſtill of this Petition,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152948:194"/>that which needs Mercy to Pardon, and therefore cannot contain Merit to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                        <p>So then all are concluded under Sin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. and conſequently under Guilt, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Sin; and conſequently under death, and a curſe the wages of Sin. And this Sin, guilt and curſe is ſo cloſely bound to every one of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, that there is no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in the beſt of them to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it: therefore O Lord teach us to pray:</p>

                              <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> is an act of Free Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our offended God freely, and without any Merit of ours, remits the Sin, the Guilt and Puniſhment; the Perſon offended is he only that can forgive: the rule was true though miſapplyed, Mar. 2.7. <hi>Who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sins but God only?</hi> and Forgiveneſs is an act of moſt free Mercy and nothing of Merit in the perſon forgiven. Iſa. 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake and will not remember thy Sins.</hi> Miſery; which is the effect of Sin, is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Mercy, but it is not the Deſert of it, eſpecially when that very Miſery, under which we are brought by Sin, is a Miſery
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152948:195"/>wilfully contracted by our ſelves, and not only ſo, but is ſtill a ſinning Miſery, a Miſery accompanied with ſtupidity and ſenſleſsneſs, with averſion &amp; oppoſition againſt that God, and that very Mercy, that ſhould deliver us. God commends the freeneſs and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Goodneſs to us, by taking that ſeaſon to be Merciful, when our condition is moſt Miſerable, not becauſe our miſery deſerves his pity. Ezek. 16.6. <hi>I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, Live: Yea, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, Live.</hi> This Forgiveneſs is <hi>thus wrought:</hi> Man, that was infinitely bound to love and obey the Author of his Being, moſt unrgatefully and unneceſſarily ſinned againſt him, and thereby deſervedly incurred the everlaſting curſe of the moſt Juſt and True God, and forfeited his being: yet, though Man had deſtroyed himſelf, Almighty God, of his own Free Will, and without any other Motive, and by his own Infinite Wiſdom, contrived a way, whereby his moſt exact Truth and Juſtice might be ſatisfied, and yet his creature ſaved, and his Mercy and Goodneſs might be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely evidenced unto Men and Angels: By an Everlaſting Covenant between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, the Son he muſt aſſume our Nature, and offer it up as One Sacrifice for Sin for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. This was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:152948:195"/>that Myſtery hid from Ages and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the Myſtery that the Angels deſire to look into, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. The Great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the Fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. The great End of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man. And by this Sacrifice thus freely given by our offended Lord, we have Redemption, even the Remiſſion of our ſins, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.14. And Pardon thus freely given by the Father, and yet thus dearly bought by the Son, is with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Love and Grace, proclaimed and tendred unto all, in all the World, that will but come in, and enter into Covenant with God in Chriſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and will remember their ſin no more.</hi> And although this one Sacrifice of Chriſt, offered up once for all, is a full ſatisfaction for all the ſins of his Elect, to the end of the World, yet the ſame eternal Contract, that made it ſo, did likewiſe appoint certain <hi>Means actually to apply it;</hi> And make it effectual to us, of Faith to lay hold upon it. And in as much as, notwithſtanding our giving up our Names to Chriſt, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed daily ſins are committed by us, our Lord teacheth us to reſort daily to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, this Magazine of Mercy, this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain opened to waſh for ſin and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thence to fetch new applications of this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152948:196"/>one Sacrifice for our renewed offence, and to beg our Pardon as often as we beg our Bread.</p>
                           <p>So then,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. We have the true <hi>Original of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the Free Love of God, which gave Chriſt as the Sacrifice for Sin, and accepted that Sacrifice as the price of our Pardon: <hi>So God loved the World, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> John 3.16.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We have the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> of it, that Sacrifice of Chriſt, whereby Pardon is impetrated for as many as lay hold upon it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Act, which that Eternal Counſel appointed to be the <hi>Means of the actual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of it to the Soul, receiving of the Pardon thus offered. <hi>To as many as received him, to them,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 1.12. For as we live, and move, and have our Being by God, and his Will, and Providence; yet the ſame Will of his hath appointed the means, whereby that Will of his is accompliſhed, our daily Bread, and the uſe of it: So, although from God we have our Pardon, yet the ſame Will of his hath appointed Faith in Chriſt, to be the inſtrument of an Actual or Effectual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it; and the Efficacy of Faith, as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152948:196"/>an inſtrument for that purpoſe, depends likewiſe upon the ſame Will of God, which hath ſo appointed. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were bitten with fiery Serpents in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to erect a brazen Serpent for their cure, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8. But, although the Divine Will had annexed a power of healing unto that Serpent inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, yet the ſame Will appointed the actual application of that power, to the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that Serpent: <hi>Every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, ſhall live:</hi> So though by the Eternal Will of God, a Pardon is obtained by the Death of Chriſt, yet the ſame Will of his hath appointed Faith in Chriſt, the means of the receiving of that Pardon: and yet this very means is not in our own power, but it is the Gift of God. John 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father draw him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. The renewed <hi>Exerciſe of that Act,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſions of ſin committed or renewed. Prayer for Pardon, which as it doth moſt naturally flow from the ſenſe of ſin, and of a Pardon impetrated by Chriſt, ſo by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, it is required to apply that Pardon actually to the Soul: and it is a high Mercy of God to grant it for the asking; and an argument of a proud unbelieving heart, to think to have it without it: and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152948:197"/>whenſoever the Spirit and the Word of God, hath wrought in a man a belief, of, and in the Sacrifice of Chriſt, the ſame Spirit doth work in the heart a deſire of it, which is nothing elſe but the Prayer of the Mind; for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion according to the Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. And herein we therefore ſee <hi>two things:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Duty.</hi> Our ſins are many, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even after we have given up our Names to Chriſt. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8. And though meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Chriſt hath ſatisfied for thoſe very ſins, yet we are to have often recourſe to this Sacrifice, to fetch our cure and our cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the actual application of this Sacrifice unto us. Had a man been bitten by a fiery Serpent, he might look upon the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and live; and had he been bitten again, he muſt have looked again, or elſe he had died: it is ſo with us, only here is the odds; the man that had been once cured, if bitten again, might perchance not have looked again upon the Serpent, and ſo have died: but it is otherwiſe here; the ſame principle of Life, that abiding ſeed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. that did at firſt make him to ſeek, and ſue to Chriſt for his firſt actual Pardon, will after a fall, a renewed ſin, ſend the Soul to this Fountain, for a new act of application,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152948:197"/>of that cleanſing and pardoning: he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commit ſin, that is, lye in it, without recourſe to God for Pardon, becauſe his Seed abideth in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Our Priviledge.</hi> If any man ſin, we have an Advocate, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. an Advocate that knows the mind of our Judge, and out of that knowledge, hath taught us as often as we beg our Bread, to beg our Pardon, and that with aſſurance that we ſhall be heard, if we do it in Faith and Sincerity. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is faithful and juſt to forgive.</hi> It is the Proclamation of his Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> It is his promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.8. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their ſin no more:</hi> Even to a revolting and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding creature, upon true repentance. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Jer. 3.12. <hi>Return thou backſliding</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and will not keep anger for ever; only acknowledge thine iniquity.</hi> Chriſt came into the World to reſtore in Man the loſt Image of God. And when <hi>Peter</hi> asked him, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.21. <hi>How
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152948:198"/>oft ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him, till ſeven times? Jeſus ſaid unto him, I ſay not unto thee till ſeven times, but till ſeventy times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times.</hi> And ſurely that Mercy, that Chriſt required in a poor mortal Man, is infinitely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the merciful God, who delights in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Forgiveneſs: Only remember,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. To take heed of Preſumptuous Sins, Premeditated Sins, Sins againſt knowledge, and againſt convictions, Sins with a preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Pardon. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. That <hi>ſhall bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart. The Lord will not ſpare him.</hi> Theſe, though they cannot exceed the Mercy of God to pardon them, they many times ſhut and ſeal up the Soul againſt Pardon, hardning the heart to a great difficulty, if not a final impoſſibility, of Repentance; and by that means the Soul is diſabled, with any comfortable ground or aſſurance to beg Pardon, without the great Mercy of God to ſoften that heart again.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Make a frequent and ſerious <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of thy paſt Actions; meaſure them by the Rule of the Word of God; and find out that accurſed thing, whatſoever it be, that is diſpleaſing to him: ſo that, as much as may be, thou maiſt diſtinctly, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to particular ſins, or faults, or fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, pray over this Petition. There is not a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152948:198"/>day, but by a wary obſervation, thou wilt not only find a general indiſtinct diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is to be the ſubject of this requeſt, but particular, ſpecial, eminent Evils, that deſerve a particular reflection upon them, in the repetition of this Petition. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turn to the Lord our God:</hi> And to this end,</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Endeavour to keep thy <hi>Conſcience</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Wakeful, Vigilant, Tender; be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to liſten to her chidings; ſhe ſoldom quarrels without a cauſe: but ſuppreſſing, checking, and ſtifling the language of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, makes her at laſt either ſullen, or ſenſeleſs, or outragious. A vigilant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will prevent thee from many ſins: but if it do not, it will tell thee of them, and bring thee upon thy knees, and make this Petition ſeaſonable, and a Pardon gotten thereupon acceptable and comfortable: for how can that Man, with any ſenſe beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for a ſin, when he ſcarce finds himſelf ſenſibly guilty of any? This Petition is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up but careleſly, and coldly, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, by ſuch a perſon.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Give God the Honour of his Juſtice, even when thou ſueſt for the Benefit of his Mercy, in <hi>aggravation of thy ſins</hi> to the due height; in owning damnation and utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as the juſt reward of every ſin, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152948:199"/>thy Soul truely and deeply for it. This will make thy Prayer earneſt, and thy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don dear; it gives to God the Honour of his Juſtice, and the Glory of his Mercy, which is all the Tribute thou can'ſt pay unto him for his free Goodneſs, in giving thee that Pardon, without which thou wert eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Give thy Mediator the Honour and End of thy Redemption. Thy Saviour died, it is true, to obtain thy Pardon, but wilt thou continue in ſin, that Grace may abound? ſin, that thou maiſt be pardoned? and renew thy ſins, that God may renew his Pardon? God forbid. Thou doſt, as much as in thee lyeth, diſappoint the End of Chriſt's Death, who therefore died, that he might redeem unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Let the begging of thy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, be ever accompanied with a reſolution not to offend again; otherwiſe God, that ſees thy heart, looks upon thy asking of Pardon, as a higher, and more impudent, and preſumptuous ſin, than that which thou ſeemeſt to beg the forgiveneſs of.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Upon the diſcovery of any particular ſin, which in a ſpecial manner concerns thee, <hi>beware of</hi> theſe things:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Sleeping in it, without recourſe to God for Pardon for it; or ſlipping over it in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152948:199"/>thy Prayer without a particular animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon it. Be content to open this ſore: The longer it is kept covered, the worſe it is. Thou muſt know that every ſin is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before God with a point of a Diamond, and though thou art contented to forget it; or by incurſion of time to wear out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, or at leaſt the horror, of it; yet it is written, and thou ſhalt be ſure to hear of it; and the longer it continues, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy heart grows; and the deeper doth the canker and ſtain of that Sin work and ſpread into thy Soul; and the more difficultly is thy Pardon obtained, and yet the leſs ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought. It is a ſecret curſe in thy boſom, that makes all thy ſervices to God unacceptable and unſavory; and who can tell when the decree may come out? when this Sin will ripen into an eminent Judgment? Therefore clear thy account with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; let not the guilt of a Sin lye long upon thy conſcience, but make thy peace betimes; ſue out thy Pardon ſpeedily. Thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Yet after a Sin freſhly committed, fall not preſently to beg thy Pardon, till thou haſt humbled thy Heart, and put it into a fit frame to come into the preſence of God; till thou haſt got a ſenſe that it is an evil thing and a bitter to depart from him; till
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152948:200"/>thou haſt crept to thy Saviours Feet for his Blood to waſh thee, and for his Righteouſneſs to cover thee, and for his Mediation to bring thee, otherwiſe a defiled polluted creature, into his Fathers preſence, under his Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; till thou haſt mourned over him, whom thou haſt pierced; and been aſhamed before him of thy miſcarriage; and acted thy Faith upon his All-ſufficient ſatisfaction; till thou haſt taken up Reſolutions of future amendment: and then in the Name and Mediation of thy Saviour, fall upon thy knees, and beg thy Pardon.</p>

And hence it is, that where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt comes, it aſſimilates the Nature to that diſpoſition, Gal. 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 2. From that great commandment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by God in the Moral Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> And much more inforced under the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, even to the Love of our very Enemies, Matt. 5.44. <hi>I ſay unto you, Love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> and conſequently forgive your <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> for Love is that affection that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Pardon, and this injunction lyes upon us under the ſame obligation whereby we are bound to love our Brethren; for the Love we owe to God is that grand Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that binds to whatſoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Joh. 14.15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments;</hi> Therefore if ye love me, love and pity, and pardon your Enemies. 3. From that great Equity and Reaſon, the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:152948:201"/>proportion of Gods dealing with us. Matt. 18.32. <hi>I forgave thee all that debt becauſe thou deſiredſt me. Shouldeſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow ſervant, even as I had pity on thee?</hi> Coloſ. 3.13. <hi>Forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and forgiving one another, even as Chriſt forgave you.</hi> If God ſhould require obedience to any command, though I ſaw no reaſon for it, yet the Love of God would conſtrain me to reaſon thus: Though I ſee no reaſon of this command, yet when I conſider who it is that commands it, even the Infinite and Merciful God, to whom I owe my ſelf and all I hope for, I ſee reaſon enough for me to obey, though I ſee not the reaſon why God ſhould command. But in this injunction of Forgiving my Enemy, I ſee a moſt juſt and proportionable reaſon of my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: I owed unto God a moſt Infinite Love and Obedience to the uttermoſt poſſibility of my Being; for from him I had it; and when I broke that Allegiance, I owed unto him an Infinite Debt of Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and with this guilt I likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an innate enmity againſt that God, to whom I owed ſo vaſt a debt of Duty and of Guilt: this very God freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my ſeeking, when I hated him, ſent me his Son with a free Pardon of all this Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Guilt, and commanded me to ſhew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:152948:201"/>to my offending brother: the offence that I committed was againſt an Infinite Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the creature to his Creator; the offence that my Brother commits as againſt me, is only againſt ſome petty relation; we are otherwiſe both equals; God free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave me, when there was nothing to enjoyn, or inforce, or deſerve, or ſo much as to ſeek it, and is it not reaſonable that I ſhould forgive my brother, that it may be ſeeks my Pardon? but if he doth not, our common Lord and Maſter enjoyns it?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Conſequently upon the former the not obſerving of this Duty, doth moſt Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Reaſonably deſerve that I ſhould not be heard in this Petition. If I can ſo boldly and unthankfully encounter a Command of God ſtanding upon ſuch juſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds, with what face I can expect a Pardon from him at my requeſt, when I refuſe to Pardon my Brother at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Conſequently alſo the pardon of my Brother is no Meritorious cauſe for God to pardon me: the Breach of any command is a meritorious cauſe of Puniſhment; but the Obſervation of one duty cannot deſerve the Pardon of the violation of another; God requires me to forgive my Brother, and when I have done ſo, I have done but my
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:152948:202"/>duty, and no not deſerve my Pardon, and therefore when I ſay, forgive me, for I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave others; I make not the Pardon I ask, the wages for the Pardon I gave; for as my Brothers offence againſt me holds not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with my offence againſt God; ſo neither doth my Pardon of him hold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Gods Pardon to me.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Nor conſequently is my Pardon of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the meaſure of that Pardon I beg of God: The offences committed by my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt me are not in truth ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed againſt me, as againſt God; for it is therefore an injury to me, becauſe done againſt that law that he hath interpoſed between him and me; and ſo though I am concerned, yet in truth the foundation of my concernment is that Law that God hath ſet between him and me; and were it poſſible to ſuppoſe no ſuch Law, it were impoſſible to conceive any injury to be done from one man to another. So then my Pardon of him is but of ſlender concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own, the chiefeſt intereſt is Gods. Again, my offence againſt God is againſt an Infinite Obligation, and againſt an Infinite Perſon; but my brothers offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, as it relates to me, is but of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite relation or obligation, and againſt a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perſon; and therefore the meaſure of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:152948:202"/>the thing forgiven by me is too ſhort and too narrow to fit and ſute with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I beg my Pardon. Again, my Pardon to my Brother is with a great deal of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuperciliouſneſs, pride, grudging, averſneſs, expoſtulations, ſecret riſings of my Heart againſt him: O! But ſuch a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don will not ſerve my turn; I beg a Pardon at the hands of the God of Mercy and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, a full, a perfect Pardon.
<q rend="margQuotes">Meaſure not out, O Lord, thy Pardon to me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Pardon to my Brother, the thing I pardon holds not proportion with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which I have committed againſt thee: his is but a finite offence againſt me, a finite Creature; mine is an infinite Offence gainſt an infinite Obligation, and againſt an Infinite God: the Pardon that I give, is mingled with ruggedneſs, with revenge, with remembrance of the thing I forgive; but the Pardon I beg of thee is an abundant Pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. A blotting out, and an everlaſting forgetting of my Sins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. Such a Pardon as leaves not behind it the tincture of my former guilt; that though my Sins were as ſcarlet, they may be as white as ſnow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.</q> But,</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Forgive us, for we forgive. By our Union with Chriſt, we partake of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of being the Sons of God; ſo that as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:152948:203"/>a Father hath tenderneſs towards his child, and is apt and ready upon his ſubmiſſion to Pardon him, ſo there is the ſame, and a far greater readineſs in him to forgive; <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my Tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the Iniquity of my Sin.</hi> As ſoon as he had but a reſolution to beg his Pardon, God prevents his Petition by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Pardon which he intended to ask. And as by this Union with Chriſt, we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Priviledge, ſo we partake of his Spirit; and that Spirit is a Merciful Spirit, ready to Pardon an Enemy even before he ask it. This was the command he gave us, and this was the Pattern he left us, <hi>who when he was reviled, reviled not again,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21, 23. but prayed for thoſe that ſought his Life, Luk. 23.34. <hi>Father, Forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> And therefore this Conformity unto the Mind of Chriſt is an Evidence unto a Man of his Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, and that God heareth him as a Father heareth his Child; and by this means Faith is ſtrengthened; and the Soul argues thus in this Petition;
<q rend="margQuotes">O Lord I am guilty in my ſelf of many Sins, but yet, if I am found in thy Son, thou wilt look upon me with the ſame tenderneſs that a Father looks upon his child, and wilt be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive me than I can be to ask it: I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152948:203"/>find thy Son was Merciful, and ready to forgive, even his Enemies; and I thank thy good Grace, I find in my ſelf the ſame mind that my Saviour bore, a mind ready to forgive the injuries that were offered him; and this diſpoſition I have not from my ſelf, nor my own ſpirit, for that ſpirit luſteth after envy; but ſurely it comes from that meek and gentle Spirit that is in thy Son: and upon this I do believe I am in ſome meaſure united to him: and as I do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Spirit, ſo I doubt not but I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that relation of his, even the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Son unto thee, and in that relation, I come before thee, and beg thee to pardon my Sins, aſſuredly truſting that thou, that haſt created in me a mind of Mercy and Forgiveneſs unto others, wilt ſhew thy ſelf a God of Mercy and Pardon unto me.</q>

                           <p n="6">6. Forgive us, for we forgive:
<q rend="margQuotes">It is true, our Pardon of others deſerves not thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor can it make thee a debtor unto us; but, Bountiful Lord, thou haſt been pleaſed in Chriſt, in whom all thy Promiſes are Yea and Amen, by thine own free Promiſe, to engage thy ſelf unto thy creature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.25.

                           </p>
                           <p>To conclude, In this Petition the Soul breathes out ſuch thoughts as theſe:
<q rend="margQuotes">O Lord, I confeſs before thee, I am a ſinful creature; I have a ſinful and polluted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Body of ſin and death; and this ſinful Nature ſends forth through all my Thoughts, Words and Actions, foul and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtreams in every moment of my Life; and if thou ſhouldeſt paſs by all the ſins of my Nature and Life unto this day, and ſhouldeſt call me to an account for my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſince I laſt begged my Pardon, there were guilt enough left to preſs me down to the loweſt Hell; And this guilt of the leaſt of any of my ſins, as it is more than I am able to anſwer, ſo it is more than I am able to expiate; there is no eſcaping but by thy free Pardon, and that Pardon I beg of thee in the Name and Righteouſneſs and Promiſe of thy Son, who knew all thy mind, and taught me to ſeek my Pardon as often as to ſeek my daily bread. And in confidence only of that free Mercy of thine, I beſeech thee, pardon me; and as I beg the Pardon of my ſins in general, ſo in ſpecial
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152948:204"/>I beg the Pardon of thoſe Sins, which I committed ſince thy laſt act of remiſſion granted, and manifeſted, and ratified unto me: this or that neglect of my Duty to thee, or my neighbour; this or that ſinful, proud, unclean, vain Thought, which hath ſtained my Soul, and grieved thy Spirit, and polluted or weakned my Conſcience; this or that uncharitable, or malicious, or unſeemly or vain Word; this or that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, or unbecoming, or unchriſtian, or ungodly Action; every one of theſe leaves a ſpot in my Soul, which nothing but the Blood of Chriſt, and thy Free Grace can take away; It leaves a Diſeaſe, a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Wound in my Soul, which nothing but thy Free Spirit can heal and recover. And though I know that my greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to others, cannot merit mercy from thee, becauſe that mercy is but my duty, and a duty mingled in the performance of it, with many of my own imperfections, which ſtand in need of thy mercy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, and that little good that is in it, is not my own, but the work of thy Grace, as free as thy Pardon; yet it is an evidence to me, that thou wilt be merciful unto me, in that thou haſt, contrary to my own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wrought a merciful temper in my heart to others, the ſame mind that was in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152948:205"/>thy Son; and therefore I am humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that thou haſt given me that Spirit of thy Son, and conſequently the relation and priviledge of a Son; that, in as much as thou haſt given me a heart to pardon others, thou wilt make good thy Promiſe of Mercy and Pardon unto me. I make mention of my remiſſion of others, not as the merit of thy forgiving of me, but thereby to ſtrengthen my Faith, and to lay hold of thy Promiſe made in and by thy Son; that if we forgive Men their offences, thou wilt alſo forgive us. And this I beg, not to make room for new offences, by pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old, nor to continue in ſin that Grace may abound; but with a reſolution to forſake my ſins, as well as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them, and not turn again to folly; ſtrengthen me ſo with thy Grace, that as thou haſt now cleanſed my Soul from my paſt ſins and ſpots, ſo I may keep my ſelf from mine Iniquity; that I may live more to thy Honour; that I may walk with more Vigilance; that I may every day find my account leſs, and thy Spirit and Grace more and more effectual in me, to conform me to the Will and Example of thy Son, in all Holineſs and Blameleſsneſs of mind and life: and to that end,</q>

                           <hi>Temptation</hi> may be underſtood (1) for an <hi>Active Solicitation</hi> unto Evil of Sin: this is done either by the Devil: thus our Saviour was led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.1. And therefore he is often called the Tempter; who being a Spirit, is, by the advantage of his Nature, and by the permiſſion of God, able to mingle himſelf ſo with our Souls and faculties, that he can immediately ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite unto Evil. Thus he mingled himſelf with the Spirits of the Prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and became a lying Spirit in their Mouths, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.21. Thus he mingled himſelf with the Spirit of <hi>Judas,</hi> tempting him to betray Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.7. with the ſpirit of

                           <hi>Ananias,</hi> Act. 5.3. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy Heart?</hi> or it is done by Evil Men, either by their Counſels, Perſwaſions, or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: or by our own corrupt hearts, <hi>James</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every Man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own Luſts and inticed.</hi> Our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſinful fleſh breathes and evaporates into our Souls thoſe ill and filthy vapors, which, infect, and diſorder, and ſeduce it from God; the Law of our Members bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us into captivity to the Law of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For that Objective Temptation, or <hi>the Object</hi> from whence occaſionally Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ariſeth. And thus almoſt every Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our ſenſe is a Temptation; not that there is any proper active motion or action of the Object to perſwade to ſin, but the corruption of our ſenſual Nature, meeting with ſuch an Object, acts amiſs upon it, and ſo it becomes a Temptation to ſin: and eſpecially if the Object be ſuch as bears a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion to our enjoyment of it; The beauty of the Apple was a Temptation to <hi>Eve;</hi> the wedge of Gold and the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Garment to <hi>Achan; Naboths</hi> Vineyard to <hi>Ahab, Bathſheba</hi> to <hi>David:</hi> yet in theſe the Objects were innocent, and had in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no active ſolicitation to Evil, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſeemingly good, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152948:206"/>corrupted Nature laid hold upon that ſeeming good, and violated the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. This taught the Wiſe man to pray againſt extreams either of Plenty or Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becauſe his corrupted Nature was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to turn either into Temptation: Riches into Arrogance and Preſumption; Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into Blaſphemy and Murmuring, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. For that Act which is not ordered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin, but to ſome Experiment or <hi>Tryal</hi> of the temper or diſpoſition that is in a Man; a Temptation of Trial. Thus God tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he commanded him to offer up his Son, to prove the ſincerity of his Love and Obedience to God; <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. <hi>By this I know that thou feareſt God.</hi> To the like purpoſe were all thoſe difficult diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the Red Sea, and in the Wilderneſs, that he might <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> them, and <hi>prove</hi> them, and to know what was in their heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. And for this end God often ſends ſeveral <hi>Afflictions</hi> upon thoſe he truely loves, that their Faith may be tryed. And theſe Tryals are called Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>Ye are in Heavineſs through manifold Temptations, that the Tryal of your Faith may be found to praiſe,</hi> &amp;c. Jam. 1.2. <hi>Count it all Joy when ye fall into divers
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152948:207"/>Temptations, knowing that the Tryal of your Faith worketh Patience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. What it is <hi>to lead into Temptation,</hi> and how God may be ſaid to lead us into them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the latter of theſe ſorts of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, they may, and do come from God; viz. <hi>Tryals</hi> of Grace, by the permitting and inflicting of afflictions. It is a work no way unbecoming his Purity and Juſtice; It is ordained to ſingular <hi>Ends.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. To his own Glory.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To the good of thoſe that he thus tryes; thereby teaching them to deſpiſe the World; to adhere unto him; to reach out after a better Life; to live by Faith and not by Senſe; patiently to ſubmit to his hand, and to wait upon him for deliverance. By this Refiners fire he conſumes their droſs, their carnal confidence, building Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles here, drives them to their true home, and gives them a proportion of Eternal Comfort and Hope, far more valuable than that Temporal comfort which they want.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As touching <hi>Temptation unto Sin,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That God tempteth no Man. He that is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, will never ſolicite any Man to that which only he hates: It is the great work of God to withdraw Men from ſin, and ſurely he will never draw Men into it. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>God
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152948:207"/>cannot be tempted with Evil, neither tempteth he any Man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. As he doth not actively tempt any Man, or move him to Evil; ſo neither doth he infuſe into the Heart or Soul a Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Temptation, he doth not excite the Heart to cloſe with any Temptation, or create or ſtir up any corruption in the Heart to take fire from a Temptation.</p>
                        <p>And yet in ſome ſort he is ſaid to <hi>lead into Temptation:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. By <hi>withdrawing</hi> that <hi>Grace</hi> of his, whereby we are prevented from, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt Temptation. We walk in the midſt of Enemies and ſnares: the Prince of the air hath his Inſtruments, that moſt Vigilantly takes all opportunities to draw us into ſin, evil Angels and evil Men; And were there not a Devil or his Inſtruments without us, to tempt us to Evil, we have an old Man within us, a fountain, a Sea of Corruption, a deceitful and wicked heart, a Body of ſin and death, that can with much advantage, and doth with much eaſe, draw us into Sin; and the merciful God that ſeeth theſe ſnares, which the evil one layes for us in our way, though we ſee them not, ſends out his own Grace and Spirit, and ſometimes removes the ſnare out of our way, ſometimes leads us another way that we miſs the ſnare:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152948:208"/>he over-rules and reſtrains this raging Sea of our own corruptions; and, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did to the Winds and Seas, commands them, Peace and be ſtill: he doth by the ſame Spirit ſtrengthen and inable our hearts to reſiſt, and oppoſe, and ſubdue thoſe Temptations that riſe from within, and comes from without. And this Grace of his he owes not to us; It is meerly of his free Mercy, Gen. 20.6. <hi>For I withheld thee from ſinning againſt me;</hi> and yet ſuch is his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he ſeldom withdraws this Grace from us, unleſs we thruſt it away and reject it; and then he withdraws that Grace of his, and that being withdrawn, that cruel and ſubtil Enemy of our Souls falls in upon us, and ſubdues us; and that Sea of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within us, that hath now no banks to keep it in, breaks in and over-whelms us. And thus was the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardned by himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15. And yet ſaid to be hardned by God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.1. By with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from him that Grace that ſhould ſoften it. And this Subduction of the Grace of God principally reſpects Temptations from our ſelves.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By <hi>Permiſſion.</hi> The Devil and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are under the reſtraint of the Power of God, and without a commiſſion or at leaſt a permiſſion, from him, cannot actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152948:208"/>execute that evil that is in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Wills: he ſolicits <hi>Job,</hi> by himſelf and his inſtruments to let go his integrity, but this he cannot do without a Permiſſion: <hi>Job.</hi> 1.12. he ſeduceth <hi>Ahab</hi> to his deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but this he cannot do without a Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.21. he tempts <hi>David</hi> to preſumption and carnal confidence, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 21.1. But this he cannot do without a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. he watcheth the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Gods diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and gets leave thereupon to tempt <hi>David</hi> to number the People: and here we may ſee the Infinire Wiſdom of God in managing that evil, that was in the Devil to tempt, and in <hi>David</hi>'s heart to be overcome, to a moſt juſt and excellent end; the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Davids</hi> ſin. Here was in the ſame action, Malice in the Devil, corruption in <hi>David,</hi> yet nothing but Purity and Juſtice in God. He never gives the Devil a Permiſſion to tempt, that Man may thereby ſin; but he turns that Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and that ſin into a work either of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Mercy or Juſtice. The Devil could not have entered into <hi>Judas</hi> without a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; nor <hi>Judas</hi> have betrayed our Lord without a Permiſſion; nor the Jews have delivered him up to Judgment without a Permiſſion; nor <hi>Pilate</hi> have judged him
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152948:209"/>without a Permiſſion, <hi>John</hi> 19.11. Here was Malice in the Devil, and Treachery in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and envy in the Jews, and Injuſtice in <hi>Pilate,</hi> and Murder in the Souldiers; and yet in God the greateſt manifeſtations of his Truth, and Juſtice, and Wiſdom, and Purity, and Mercy, that ever the World did or ſhall ſee. While he permits the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſin, he, nor his action, is in no ſort defiled by it, but manageth that ſin, which is none of his, to bring forth that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is only his.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He is ſaid to lead into Temptation, by the External <hi>Diſpenſation of his Providence,</hi> and that:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By <hi>withdrawing</hi> thoſe <hi>External re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints</hi> from ſin; ſuch are the taking away of good Men, good Governours, good Laws. So much Goodneſs as is in theſe is his own; and he may juſtly call home what is his. As the reſtraining Grace that he lends to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man is not due to him, ſo theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reſtraints, they are not due to us; but they are the free Mercy and Favour of God; and yet as in the former, ſo in this, the removal of them is ſeldom but upon ſome eminent ſin. When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt God he takes from them the Prudent, and the Antient, and the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Man, and the Counſellor, and gives
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152948:209"/>them Children to be their Princes. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.2. when his Vineyard brings forth wild grapes, he takes away the hedge thereof: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.5. the good Order, and Rule, and Laws among them. When God is angry with a Man, or a People, Governours of exemplary goodneſs are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, not only from the Evil to come; but by their being taken away, Evil ſucceeds, evil Manners, and then evil Events.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By <hi>propoſing of Objects,</hi> which, though they have no evil in them, nor are they propounded to the end to draw Men to Evil; yet the Evil heart of Man takes opportunity by them to act unto Evil. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters could have no more made Blood by their Inchantments without a Permiſſion, than they could make Lice;
<note place="margin">Exo. 8.18.</note> yet by that act of theirs <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his heart was hardned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.22. Again when, upon the importunity of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the Prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Plague of Frogs was removed, it was an act of Mercy in God; yet when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw there was reſpite, he hardned his heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15. And here appears that Sea of Poyſon that is in our heart by Nature, that will corrupt an innocent object, as was the wedg of gold; a Mercy, as was this to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> nay the very Grace, and Goodneſs, and Patience, and Bounty of God into a Temptation to Covetouſneſs, Preſumption, Wantonneſs.</p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:152948:210"/>
                        <p>Now from this Petition we learn <hi>our Duty</hi> in reference unto theſe Temptations:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In reference to ſuch Temptations, which God is pleaſed oftentimes to ſend for <hi>Tryal,</hi> ſuch as are Afflictions and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we are not to ſeek them. Our Savious teacheth us to pray againſt all Temptationr; they are not in themſelves good, but are turned to good by the Wiſe and Merciful hand of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That if we fall into them, to be quiet and contented, and to diſcern the hand that hath led us into them, and the end why he did, and to co-operate to that end: to learn by them Patience under the hand of God; Confidence in his Grace and Power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us; ſtill to hold our Integrity; not to be amazed and diſordered, as if ſome ſtrange thing had befallen us, but reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Promiſe of his, who is faithful and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but with the Temptation will make a way to eſcape. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Know that it is he, whoſe Will thou haſt before prayed may be done, that hath led thee into this Temptation. And by this means thy Temptarion ſhall be only a Temptation of Tryal, and for thy Advantage; not a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Seduction.</p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:152948:210"/>
                        <p n="3">3. To pray unto God:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To prevent us from them: for as they are not to be ſought, ſo all due means is to be uſed to avoid them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To be delivered out of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To be ſupported in them; 1. with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to bear them. 2. with Grace to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to Gods End; and if God ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, as once he did to Paul, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> it will become an act of Heavenly Chymiſtry to turn thy Iron into Gold, thy Temptation into Advantage.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In reference to <hi>Temptations unto ſin,</hi> we learn <hi>two ſpecial Duties,</hi> Watchfulneſs and Prayer, both joyned together by our Saviour for this purpoſe, Matt. 26.41. <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Watch; (1) That thou be not a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and therein,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Beware of Tempting God: (for ſuch Tempters there have been:) (1) By Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſumptuous caſting our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unneceſſary dangers, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.6.7. (2) by Murmuring and diſcontent, Exod. 17.2. <hi>Why tempt ye the Lord?</hi> Deut. 6.16. Pſal. 78.18. <hi>They tempted God in their Heart by asking meat for their Luſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Beware of Tempting the <hi>Devil;</hi> for ſuch is the Villany of our Nature, that we are
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152948:211"/>ready even to ſolicite the Devil himſelf unto Temptation, by adventuring upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unwarrantable Arts, unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practices, going to Witches, uſing Charms, Invocations, or willingly being in ſuch places where they are uſed; adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing into unwarrantable places or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies without any juſt or reaſonable cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereunto.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Beware of tempting <hi>Others</hi> unto any ſin, either by thy Perſwaſion, or by thy Practice. The former is more groſs, the latter well near as dangerous; 1. to the perſon offending; Matt. 18.7. <hi>Wo be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World becauſe of offences.</hi> 2. unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially when the occaſion is given by a perſon in eminence of Place or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Peters</hi> diſſimulation proves a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. and this extends not only to things ſimply evil, but alſo to the practice of things in themſelves indifferent: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. Rom. 14.15. <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt dyed.</hi> The thing that to thee is indifferent, and ſo eſteemed by thee, when it ſhall draw another into the like practice upon thy Example, but againſt his Conſcience becomes an occaſion to loſe his Soul.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Beware of tempting <hi>Thy ſelf;</hi> and this may be done divers ways:</p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:152948:211"/>
                        <p n="1">1. By giving way to wandering and <hi>vain Thoughts.</hi> They miſlead the heart, indiſpoſe for Good, corrupt the mind, poſſeſs it with vanity; as for Example, when a Man will raiſe an imagination to himſelf, that if he had ſuch a degree of Wealth, and then what Houſes he would build, what Retinue he would have, what Table he would keep, what Equipage he would have; or fancy to himſelf, that if he had ſuch a degree of Power, then how he would revenge ſuch an Enemy, how he would honour ſuch a Friend, and the like. Such is the vanity of our minds that it can, and often doth, frame ſuch ſimilitudes to it ſelf, and upon them beget ſuch follies and vain reſolutions as theſe. The temptation and ſin that ariſeth out of Wealth and Power really injoyed, are thoſe very workings of the mind upon them: <hi>viz.</hi> Confidence, Oſtentation, Pride, Revenge and the like. Now in theſe Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and vain Thoughts, the Soul tempts it ſelf in a double way: Firſt, he tempts his underſtanding into a Lye and a falſehood, by putting himſelf into that imaginary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which he is not. 2. He tempts himſelf in his Will and Affections, drawing from thoſe very imaginations that he hath thus framed thoſe very ſame miſchiefs, and that very ſame poiſon, if not worſe,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152948:212"/>which his corrupted Heart would have drawn from the real injoyment of that very Power or Wealth, which he hath imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to have; and thereby improveth this very Imagination into a real Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtaining, corrupting and poyſoning his mind, and commits adultery with his own Imagination. <hi>O Jeruſalem, cleanſe thy ſelf: how long ſhall vain thoughts, lodge within thee?</hi> Jer. 4.14.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Idleneſs.</hi> And from this Idleneſs and want of Imployment the Soul runs out ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into theſe vain Imaginations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of before, or into unprofitable or ſinful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; and to theſe the Devil joyneth himſelf, and if he finds a Man not buſied in what he ſhould be, he will help him to buſie himſelf in what he ſhould not be: <hi>David</hi> was walking careleſsly upon his houſe, ſees and luſts, and ſins: he therefore that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows himſelf to Idleneſs, thereby tempts himſelf to be tempted by himſelf, or by the Devil.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Truſting a Mans ſelf too much unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily with, or in, Places, Companies, or Objects, that carry in them Temptations to ſin; ſuch as are rude, impious, or wanton company, or converſation; Stage-Plays; filthy or wanton ſongs, books, pictures; Places of Idolatrous worſhip; preſence at
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:152948:212"/>Atheiſtical, irreligious diſputes or diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; reading books or diſcourſes againſt the Deity, the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c. Joſeph</hi> declined converſation with his adulterous Miſtreſs: <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.10. He hearkned not to her to lye by her, or to be with her. And when the wiſe Man diſſwadeth from the practice of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perſons, he forbids to walk in the way with them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.15. and not to come nigh the door of her houſe. <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.8. not to look upon the Wine when it gives its colour in the Glaſs. And a Man, that thus truſts himſelf with objects or companies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily, tempts himſelf: and it is a kind of preſumption to expect, and rare to find, that he comes off without ſome diſadvantage. He that hath taught us to pray that we be not led into Temptation, hath given no promiſe of Grace to deliver us from that Temptation, which contrary to our Prayer and duty we ſeek.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As we muſt watch over our ſelves that we tempt not our ſelves or others, ſo we muſt watch that we be not tempted; or if tempted, that we be not overtaken: and for that purpoſe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Watch over thy ways,</hi> and ſee that the ways thou goeſt in be warrantable ways, ways that thou haſt a commiſſion of God to walk in, the ways of thy Chriſtian duty, the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152948:213"/>ways that are commended or allowed by the Word of God, the ways of thy lawful profeſſion. If they be ſuch, thou mayſt be confident that he, that hath given his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge over thee, to protect thee in all thy ways, will remove out of this way of thine thoſe Snares, that the Devil lays for thee, or at leaſt will lead thee beſides them. It is true, the Enemy hath his Traps hid as well in our ways, as out of our ways; but when we are out of our warrantable ways, the very way wherein we are is a ſnare, and is likewiſe all ſtrewed with ſnares and traps for us; and we have no promiſe of direction or protection from God in ſuch by-ways. Therefore conſider diligently, Am I in a lawful way? have I a calling or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God or his Word to walk in this way, or to be about this buſineſs? if ſo, well then, I will truſt on him for protection, I am in the great Kings High-way: but if not, then I am in an Enemies Country, I have not the protection or promiſe of God, I am like to meet with Temptations, and to fall under them, I am out of my way, and I know not whether this wandring fire will lead me. And this is the meaning of the wiſe man, Pro. 4.26. <hi>Ponder the way of thy feet, and let all thy ways be eſtabliſhed:</hi> That is, conſider what way thou art in, and be ſure it be a right, and ſound, and warrantable way.</p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:152948:213"/>
                        <p n="2">2. Labour to have thy <hi>converſation and walking</hi> to be <hi>with God,</hi> in his Preſence, and keep a conſtant communion with him: for ſuch is his condeſcention to his poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he is pleaſed to allow us to walk with him if we will. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me and be perfect,</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. That is, to endeavour to have the whole frame of our converſation as before him, and to have continual communion with him in all the way of our Life; and not only at the ſelect and ſolemn times of Prayer, but in the general Frame of our converſation. And if thou haſt ſuch a Guide, he will be to thy Soul, even in the darkeſt and moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous times, what he was once to his own People, a Pillar of fire, that thou mayſt ſee thy way before thee, and he will ſhew thee where the ſnare lyes, and how to avoid it; nay, if thou ſlip into it, he that leads thee by thy hand, will pull thee out of it, and will not ſuffer thy foot to ſlide.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When any <hi>Action of any conſiderable or unuſual nature</hi> is to be undertaken by thee, that is ſomewhat beyond or beſide the ordinary track of thy Life, let this have a <hi>ſpecial and diſtinct examination,</hi> and be not content with that general care of thy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152948:214"/>way, but bring it to a more particular ſcrutiny.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Conſider how it becomes the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and whether it will abide to be brought before him without ſome regret and ſhame: how if this were the laſt action of thy Life, and preſently to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Judgment, whether it would abide that Tryal.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Conſider whether it be allowed or condemned by the Word of God, or what part or what circumſtance thereof will not abide that Examination.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Bid thy Conſcience plainly and truly tell thee what ſhe thinks of it, and of every part of it, and what ſhe likes, and what ſhe diſlikes of it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. See if there be any thing in it that thou wouldeſt be aſhamed to own it before Men, or any part of it.</p>
                        <p>And if upon theſe Examinations thou canſt clear the action to be agreeable to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and the Word of God, the Teſtimony of thy Conſcience, and dareſt to expoſe it to the Judgment of Men, do it: but if it fails in any (as when it fails in any, be ſure it fails in all, though happily in ſome particular, according to the different conſtitution of a Man, and the nature of the thing, the exorbitancy will be more apparent, it may
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152948:214"/>be, in one than in another; for all ſin flyes the Preſence of God, croſſes the Word of God, hurts the Conſcience and brings ſhame) reject it or ſo much of it, as upon this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination will not abide this teſt; there is a Temptation in it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Upon ſuch a diſcovery of ſin in the action to be undertaken, <hi>hold not diſpute with thy own corrupt Heart</hi> long about it, but reject it without any more reaſonings; for if thou enter into debate with thy heart, ſhe is a Sophiſter and will deceive thee; ſhe will diſtinguiſh, and put differences, and inforce the neceſſity or convenience of the buſineſs, the poſſibility of a greater good which may outweigh the evil, the inconſiderableneſs of that crookedneſs that thou haſt diſcovered, and by degrees at laſt over-work thee and bring thee about. And the Devil is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be aſſiſtant in this diſpute and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe. When <hi>Eve</hi> entered into diſcourſe and diſpute with the Devil, and heard his reaſons, and argued the Caſe, he over-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in her Innocence, to offend againſt a moſt expreſs and a moſt penal Law: and how much eaſier will the conqueſt be over a corrupt and weak Soul, when the treacherous fleſh is won already without any perſwaſion?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If thy <hi>Temptation</hi> be <hi>importunate,</hi> lay
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152948:215"/>againſt it in the other ballance theſe two conſiderations, and if thou wilt be reaſoning with thy Temptation, reaſon thus:
<q rend="margQuotes">I am now perſwaded and ſolicited to this action, wherein upon Examination I find appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently a ſin againſt God and my own Life; and it is true, I have propounded to me the Neceſſity, or the Profit, or the Pleaſure of it, but I know I am now in the Peſence of the Glorious and Eternal God, that hath power to bring me out of this Neceſſity without the help of this ſinful action, and is able to blaſt this action, that it ſhall not ſerve to accommodate this Neceſſity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God who is Lord of all the wealth in the world, and hath promiſed that he will not leave me nor forſake me; I am before that God that hath promiſed Eternal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore to thoſe that fear him, and can mingle or follow this pleaſure that I expect from this temptation with a moſt bitter curſe, even unto all Eternity; And it is this God that hath forbidden me to commit this Sin, and doth ſtand to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will abide by his Command, or ſide with his Enemy; I am before my Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that laid down his life for me, became a curſe to redeem me, as well from my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to ſin for the time to come, as from the guilt of ſin for the time paſt; and that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152948:215"/>
                              <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtands and beholds whether I now value or deſpiſe that Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and is accordingly ready with Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance or Glory to reward me; I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe glorious and pure Spirits, the elect Angels, whom God hath hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as Miniſters for my preſervation, that ſee and obſerve whether I hold a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the Purity of their Natures, or whether I will foul my ſelf in this filth, and partake with their Enemy the Prince of this World. Could the Eyes of my ſenſe behold the leaſt of that Glory that beholds me, it would make me aſhamed of my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt actions; and though I ſee it not, I am certain it ſees me. With what face can I then commit this Villany in the Preſence of that God, to whom I, and all the World owe our being? before the face of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who hath laid down his Life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue and redeem mine? before thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels who at the command of God are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be Miniſtring Spirits for my preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? how ſhall I grieve that Spirit, whom I hear at this very inſtant whiſper unto me, Do not that abominable thing which I hate? and what will the end of this be? will it not be a ſtain to my Soul, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the End? what can this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promiſe me that it can perform? or if
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152948:216"/>it can perform what it promiſeth, and promiſe what it will, can it promiſe that to me which can be equivalent to the loſs of the favour and preſence of the Eternal God? the loſs and ruine of my immortal Soul? can it countervail the ſhame and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that will enſue upon a contempt committed to the Majeſty and Mercy of the Eternal God, before whoſe immediate view I am now baſely and contemptuouſly, at the ſolicitation of his and mine Enemy, going about to commit this evil?</q> 
                           <hi>Again,</hi> 2. Let me but conſider, that with the ſame meaſure of ſhame that I ſhall ſubmit to this Temptation, with the ſame meaſure of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Glory ſhall I reſiſt it. When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that in the View and Preſence of the Glorious God, of my Merciful and Tender Saviour, of the Pure and Bleſſed Spirits, thoſe Glorious Courtiers of Heaven, I ſhall give a Teſtimony of my Love to God, I ſhall reſiſt and reject the Solicitation of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Heaven, and hold faſt mine Integrity. Could <hi>Job</hi> have but heard that approbation which God gave of it after the Devil had practiſed his Experiments, Job. 2.3. That <hi>he ſtill holdeth faſt his Integrity, though thou moveſt me againſt him,</hi> it would have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied him for all his Loſſes, and abundantly ſtrengthened his Heart againſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152948:216"/>all future Temptations. And what we read of him, we may be ſure is true concerning our ſelves; the ſame practices by the Devil to ſeduce us, and the ſame atteſtation given by the Eternal God, if we reſiſt his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But which is more than this, the Eternal God, as he ſtands by to ſee my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, ſo he ſtands by me to ſupply me with ſtrength, if I ſeek to him for it, and with an Immortal Crown to reward me in that Victory over my temptation, which his own ſtrength hath given me. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay in the ballance againſt the Pleaſure or Profit of my Temptation, the Shame and the Puniſhment from that God that beholds me; and againſt my loſs in the reſiſting it, the Glory and Advantage in the Preſence of God, that I ſhall obtain in overcoming it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Carry with thee a jealous and <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye over thy ſelf in all Conditions and Actions.</hi> For there is a Snare and a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every thing thou doſt, or that doth befal thee.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Take heed to thy <hi>Senſes</hi> and their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: thou haſt an Evil <hi>Eye,</hi> a covetous Eye, a wanton and adulterous Eye, and envious Eye, and unſatiable Eye; thou haſt an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ear,</hi> or an Ear open to vanity, dull of hearing, when that thou heareſt is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;

Either they ſhall be known exactly without a minutes ſtudy, or they will be unuſeful, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to thee; whereas every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes time thou ſpendeſt here in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy Knowledge of God and his Word is ſowing of a Seed, that ſhall in thy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul, yield a Harveſt ſuitable to her condition.</p>

Take heed to thy <hi>Memory,</hi> it is apt to receive the Figures and Impreſſions of vain or ſinful Words or Actions; and the Devil is apt to turn that ſide of the Glaſs to thy Soul, that contains thoſe Characters, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſuch times, when it may divert thee from, or diſturb thee in better Thoughts, or Imployments.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Take heed to thy <hi>Heart,</hi> it is a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart, a treacherous and a falſe Heart,

In the <hi>Purſuit</hi> of them, it begets Covetouſneſs, Ambition, unlawful Means. In the <hi>Fruition</hi> of them, it begets Pride and Inſolence and carnal Confidence.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152948:218"/>In the <hi>Want</hi> of them it begets Murmuring, and Diſcontent and Envy: In the <hi>Uſe</hi> of things lawful it begets exceſs and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and unſeaſonableneſs: In the <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> of things commendable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, it begets Arrogance, Self-attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Vain-Glory, Overprizing of them and of it ſelf for them, opinion of Merit, a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Priviledge to offend in other things becauſe of the due performance of theſe. And thus we cannot want a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo long as we carry about us a heart ſo full of corruption; Therefore carry a ſtrict and diligent hand over thy heart; for it hath in it a fountain, a ſeed, a ſtock of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>

                        <p>To conclude therefore this part of this Petition:
<q rend="margQuotes">O Lord God Almighty, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeſt all my ways, I find that I walk in the midſt of Snares and Temptations; <hi>the great Enemy</hi> of my Salvation and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue are continually about me, and watch for my halting, ſecretly and undiſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſoliciting my Soul to ſin againſt thee, almoſt in every occurrence of my life, and every motion of my mind; and having in any thing prevailed againſt me, either he quiets my Soul in my ſin, or diſorders my Soul for it, and by both prevents or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts me from coming to thee to ſeek my Pardon, as a thing not neceſſary to be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or impoſſible to be gained: Again, the <hi>Men,</hi> among whom I live, ſcatter their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152948:221"/>temptations for me, by Perſwaſions to ſin, by evil Examples, by ſucceſs in ſinful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; And if there were no Devil or Man to tempt me, yet I find in <hi>my ſelf</hi> an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſeed of Temptations, a ſtock of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, that forms all I am, and all I have or do, even <hi>thy very Mercies,</hi> into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; when I conſider <hi>thy Patience and Goodneſs</hi> to me, I am tempted to Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to Supineneſs, to an Opinion of my own worth; when I conſider or find <hi>thy Juſtice,</hi> I am tempted to Murmuring, to deſpair, to think the moſt Soveraign Lord a hard Maſter. In <hi>my Underſtanding,</hi> I am tempted to ſecret Argumentation, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, to Infidelity, to diſpute thy Truth, to curioſity, to impertinent or forbidden enquiries. If I have <hi>Learning,</hi> it makes me Proud, apt to deſpiſe the purity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of thy Truth, to contend for Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not for Truth, to uſe my Wit to reaſon my ſelf or others into Errors or Sins, to ſpend my time in thoſe diſcoveries, that do not countervail the expence, nor are of any value or uſe to my Soul after death. In my <hi>Will</hi> I find much averſeneſs to what is good, a ready motion to every thing that is evil, or at leaſt an incertain fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between both: In all my <hi>Thoughts</hi> I find abundance of Vanity; when imployed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152948:221"/>to any thoughts of moſt concernment to my Soul, full of inconſiſtency, unfixt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled, eaſily interrupted, mingled with groſs apprehenſions. When I look into my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> I find her eaſily bribed, and brought over to the wrong party, allayed with ſelf-love, if not wholly ſilent, unprofitable, and dead. In my <hi>Affections</hi> I find continued diſorder, eaſily miſplaced, and more eaſily over-acted beyond the bounds of Moderation, Reaſon, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, much more of Chriſtianity and thy Fear. In my <hi>ſenſual Appetite</hi> I find a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fog and vapour riſing from it, diſordering my Soul in all I am about with unſeaſonable, importunate, and foul exhalations, that darken and pollute it, that divert and diſturb it in all that is good, that continually ſolicit it to all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Evils, unto all immoderation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. In my <hi>Senſes</hi> I have an <hi>Eye</hi> full of Wantonneſs, full of Covetouſneſs, full of Haughtineſs; an <hi>Ear</hi> full of Itching after novelties, impertinencies, vanities; <hi>a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> full of Intemperance, ſtudious for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities; a <hi>Hand</hi> full of violence, when it is in my power; a <hi>Tongue</hi> full of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vain words, apt to ſlander, to whiſper, full of vain-glory and ſelf-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. If thou giveſt me a <hi>healthy ſtrong Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
                              <pb n="184" facs="tcp:152948:222"/>I am ready to be proud of it, apt to think my ſelf out of the reach of ſickneſs or death; It keeps me from thinking of my latter end, or providing for it; I am ready to uſe that ſtrength to the ſervice of ſin, with better advantage, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and leſs remorſe. If thou viſiteſt me with <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> I am ſurpriſed with Peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Impatience, with ſolicitous care touching my Eſtate and Poſterity, and Recovery; and my thoughts concerning thee leſs frequent, leſs profitable than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though my neceſſity be greater.

If thou viſiteſt me with <hi>Poverty,</hi> I am apt to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, to count the Rich happy, to caſt off thy ſervice as unprofitable, to look upon my everlaſting hopes as things at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Imaginary Comforts under Real wants. If thou giveſt me <hi>Reputation</hi> and Eſteem in the World, I am apt to make uſe of it to bear me out at a pinch in ſome unlawful action, to uſe it to miſlead others, to uſe any baſe ſhift to ſupport it.

                              <pb n="185" facs="tcp:152948:222"/>my heart is apt to ſwell againſt the means, to ſtudy Revenge, and to die with my Reputation, though it may cauſeleſly be loſt, and to have the thoughts and remembrance of it to interfere and grate upon my Soul, even in my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice to thee: any <hi>Croſs</hi> ſowers at my bleſſings, and carries my heart ſo violently, into diſcontent, for, it may be, all ſingle affliction, which I deſervedly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that I forget to be thankful for a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other Mercies, which I undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly enjoy. If I am about a good <hi>Duty,</hi> I find my heart tempted to perform them Careleſly, Formally, Negligently, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically, Vain-gloriouſly, for falſe or by-Ends; and when I have done them, my heart is puft up with Pride, opinion of Merit, looking upon my Maker as my Debtor for the Duty I owe him, and yet but ſlightly and defectively performed to him; How then can I expect Power from my ſelf to reſiſt a Temptation without, when I find ſo much treachery within me? I therefore beſeech thee, moſt Merciful and Powerful Father, to ſend into my heart the Grace and ſtrength of thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit to reſiſt and overcome all my Temptations, to cleanſe and purge this foul heart of mine of this brood and neſt

The Evil <hi>of Sin.</hi> We are before taught to pray for pardoning Mercy in the firſt Petition; for preventing Mercy in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Petition; and here we are taught to pray for delivering, reſtoring Mercy. When a ſin is committed, there is not only a guilt contracted, which ſtands in need of Mercy to pardon it; but the Soul receives a Wound that weakens it,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152948:223"/>and ſtands in need of a Divine ſtrength to reſtore it; and without this it would never riſe out of that ſtate of Impotency, yea of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion into which it is fallen, but would mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply ſin upon ſin to all Eternity.

                  <p>Thou art the great Creator, Lord and Governor of all the World; and art in a more ſpecial relation the Soveraign, the Father, the great Benefactor of Man-kind; and therefore may'ſt moſt juſtly expect from the children of Men our uttermoſt Love, and Fear, and Reverence and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and thou haſt by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by that greater Light of thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word, revealed unto us a moſt Holy and Righteous Law, to which we owe a moſt entire and ſincere Obedience: and yet notwithſtanding all theſe obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we poor ſinful Creatures do daily and hourly violate that Holy Law of thine, both in Thought, Word and Deed: we omit much of what thou requireſt of us; and we commit often what thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeſt us: we are deficient in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thee, in our Love to thee, in our Fear of thee. We often omit thoſe Duties that thou requireſt, of Invocation,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152948:236"/>Thankſgiving, Dependance; and when we perform them, they want that due meaſure of Love, Humility, Reverence, Intention of mind, that thou moſt juſtly doſt require and deſerve: we omit thoſe duties of Charity, Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, that we owe to others; that Sobriety, Temperance, Moderation, Vigilance, that relate to our ſelves; and we daily commit offences againſt thee, the Glorious God; againſt our neighbours; againſt our ſelves; contrary to the injunctions of thy Holy Law revealed to us: and theſe we often reiterate againſt Mercies, Chaſtiſements, Promiſes of better Obedience. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of our Neglects and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces immediately concern our ſelves or others, yet they are all offences againſt thy Holy and Righteous Law; and againſt that Subjection, and Obedience, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Thankfulneſs, that we owe unto thee. And when we have done all this, we are not able to make thee any ſatisfaction, for any of the leaſt of our offences or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, but only to confeſs our Guilt, and to beg thy Mercy, Pardon and Forgiveneſs. We therefore come unto thee, who art our Lord and Soveraign, whoſe Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it is to forgive Iniquity, Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sin; to thee, which art our Father,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:152948:237"/>who art full of Pity and Compaſſion to thy Children, though diſobedient and backſliding Children; to thee, who art a Father of Mercies as well as of Men; and haſt delight in Forgiving thy diſobedient and returning and repenting Children: and we confeſs our Sins, our backſlidings, our failings. And upon the account of thy own Mercy and Goodneſs, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thy Son's Merits and Sufferings, upon the account of thy own Promiſes contained in that Word, whereupon thou haſt cauſed thy Servants to truſt, Pardon the ſins of our Duties, and the ſins of our Lives; the ſins of our Natures, and the ſins of our Practice; the ſins of our Thoughts, Words and Actions; the ſins of Omiſſion, and the ſins of Commiſſion; the ſins of Infirmity, Failing and daily Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the ſins of Wilfulneſs, Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rebellion, whereof we ſtand guilty before thee. Our Requeſt, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is great. The Debt whereof we deſire Forgiveneſs, is a great and a vaſt debt: but we ask it of the great and glorious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the World; we ask it of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful Father; and from that glorious God, who rejoyceth more in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying Pardons upon repenting ſinners, than the Children of Men can delight in offending.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And beſides all this, we have been taught by him that knew thy Will to the full, that if we from our hearts forgive thoſe that treſpaſs againſt us, thou that art our Heavenly Father wilt forgive us our Treſpaſſes againſt thee. Upon this Promiſe of thine we lay hold. In obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thy Commands, we forgive our brethren their offences againſt us, and beg thee therefore to make good that thy Promiſe, of <hi>Forgive us our offences.</hi> It is true, our forgiving of others cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thy Pardon of us. When we forgive, we do but our duty, becauſe thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt it. And beſides, the Treſpaſs that we remit is but to our Brother, and is but a ſmall inconſiderable treſpaſs, in compariſon of thoſe Treſpaſſes whereof we beg the forgiveneſs of Thee: his Treſpaſs not an hundred pence, ours more than ten thouſand talents. Yet, bleſſed Lord, give us leave to lay hold upon thy Promiſe, which thou haft free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, and to ſtrengthen our hearts in this, that that God that hath commanded us to forgive our repenting Brother, will not deny a Pardon to his repenting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that God that hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to promiſe forgiveneſs to us upon our forgiveneſs of others, is a God of Truth
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:152948:238"/>and Faithfulneſs, as well as a Father of Mercies: and though our forgiveneſs of our Brother cannot in any proportion deſerve our God's forgiveneſs of us, yet when the God of Truth hath freely inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf by his Word to forgive us, if we forgive, he will never break it: and he that hath raiſed in our hearts by his Grace this Merciful temper and diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, hath thereby given us a pledge of his Mercy and Goodneſs unto us in Pardoning all our offences.</p>

                  <p>And becauſe we are weak and frail Creatures, ſubject to be overcome with every Temptation to depart from our duty to thee; and we hourly converſe with all varieties of Temptations; Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the World; Temptations from Satan, the Prince of this World; and, which is the worſt of all, Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from our own ſinful hearts, corrupt natures, unruly affections; and without thy continual Grace Preventing or Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, the leaſt of all theſe our Enemies and Temptations are able to over-match us: And becauſe we are obnoxious to Temptations in all our actions, in all our conditions, in all our wants, and in all our enjoyments; in our lawful actions we are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152948:238"/>ſubject to the Temptation of Immodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exceſs; in our religious actions, to Formality and Vain-Glory; in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, to Pride and Forgetfulneſs of thee; in Adverſity, to Murmuring, and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and Accuſing of thy Providence; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Injuries, to Vindictiveneſs and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Anger; under Comforts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, to Security and Abatement of our Love to thee, and ſetting up our hopes and our reſt upon the preſent World; in our Knowledge, to vain and impertinent Curioſity, Pride and Self-conceit; in caſes of Wants, to unlawful Means for our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; in caſe of Abundance, to Luxury, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Contempt of others; in Sickneſs, to Impatience; in Health, to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and Forgetfulneſs of our latter ends; in our Callings, either to Negligence, Unfaithfulneſs and Idleneſs on the one hand, or to overmuch Solicitouſneſs and vexation on the other hand: If we are in Company, we are in danger to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided by evil Perſwaſions or Examples from others; if we are alone, we are apt to be corrupted by the evil ſuggeſtions of our own corrupt hearts, or of that evil one, that watcheth all opportunities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeduce or miſchief us.

Thy Subjects are all of thy own making; and all the good that is in them, or enjoyed by them, is derived from thee to them. The Strength and Glory and Beauty and Excellence of thy Kingdom
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152948:240"/>is not derived from thy Subjects, but from thy Self to them. And therefore, though my Petitions be great, they are fit to be ſuch, becauſe directed to the Mighty Creator and King and Monarch of the whole Univerſe, the Root and Fountain of all Being and Goodneſs.</p>
